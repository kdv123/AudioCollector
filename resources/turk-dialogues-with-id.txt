7	b2	He did, but there was too much stuff to get out with that method.
8	a3	So what did he have to do?

28	b2	My job is concerned mainly with computer networking.
29	a3	Are you excited about the change?
29	b3	Yes, but I'm worried my coworkers won't like me.
30	a1	will you play?
30	b1	Yes, sounds fun!
31	a2	It is! After we build the blanket fort we are going to have a pillow fight!
31	b2	I will destroy you! I'm a pillow fighting champion!
32	a3	We'll see about that!
32	b3	Where will we set up the fort?
33	a1	Do you want to walk around the park?
33	b1	No, the weather is too gloomy.
34	a2	It's not that bad outside!
34	b2	Well there's a lot of rain and the thunder and lightning seem pretty close. You really still want to go out to the park?

38	b3	Are you coming with me?
39	a1	Would you like to watch a movie on Netflix with me?
39	b1	Sure, why not. What should we watch?
40	a2	I'm sure there's another Adam Sandler movie. I think he makes one a week.
40	b2	Yeah, that's why we shouldn't watch one of them. They're too boring and predictable.
41	a3	I think Deadpool is available. it's supposed to be stupid funny.
41	b3	No, i've seen it. It was worse than you could imagine.
42	a1	Would you please pick up a birthday gift and a card for my granddaughter?
42	b1	Yes, I will get both of those for you.
43	a2	What is she into right now?
43	b2	She really likes the screaming music, you know the one you can't understand.
44	a3	Oh well, I would need some advice then!
44	b3	No worries I ll get them.
45	a1	What are you doing this weekend?
45	b1	I'm going to the beach.
46	a2	I hope it's not raining.
46	b2	Yeah I want to work on my tan this weekend.
47	a3	Do you mind if I come?
47	b3	Wow I d love if you join.
48	a1	What's the dosage of my medicines?
48	b1	I don't know. I'll have to check the labels on all the bottles.
49	a2	Thanks. I'll have to write them down next time.
49	b2	Let me get a pencil and do that for you now.
50	a3	I appreciate it. It's hard to keep track of all this!
50	b3	I'm happy to help!
51	a1	Hmm, what was that guy's name?
51	b1	I didn't catch it either.
52	a2	I think it started with an 'S'.
52	b2	It might have been Shane.
53	a3	I'll ask him to remind me next time I see him.
53	b3	Good idea. Shane or Sean, I think.
54	a1	What is for dinner?
54	b1	Whatever you're making for us, dear.
55	a2	What do you feel like having?
55	b2	Why do I have to decide?
56	a3	OK, then I'll decide, but you have to promise not to wrinkle your nose when I tell you what I'm making.
56	b3	Not a problem!
57	a1	How long have you been driving?
57	b1	You mean today or for my lifetime? Today for about a 1/2 hour; for my life, about 12 years.
58	a2	I meant your lifetime.
58	b2	Well there you go.
59	a3	What cars have you driven since you've been driving?
59	b3	That were mine? Two.
60	a1	What are we having for breakfast?
60	b1	Pancakes and bacon.
61	a2	Sorry, I'm allergic to bacon.
61	b2	Should I make sausage instead?
62	a3	no idon't like it
62	b3	Well what do you want?
63	a1	How did your vacation in California go?
63	b1	My vacation was great, thanks!
64	a2	Where did you go in California?
64	b2	We went into San Fransisco to do the usual tour stops!
65	a3	You should have gone off the beaten path. There's more to California than San Francisco.
65	b3	Have you thought about checking out ghost towns?
66	a1	Do cats like rain?
66	b1	No. Because cats hate to get wet.
67	a2	But tigers love to swim, so maybe some cats like rain, right?
67	b2	You must be a lot of fun at parties.
68	a3	And you must not know many cats.
68	b3	No, thankfully! I am a dog person.
69	a1	Can you get me a blanket please?
69	b1	Sure, here you go
70	a2	Thanks, can you wrap it around mt feet?
70	b2	Sure, is that comfortable?
71	a3	Oh yes, that's wonderful.
71	b3	Do you want me to massage your shoulders?
72	a1	Did you go out last night?
72	b1	No, I stayed in and ordered pizza.
73	a2	Me, too! We should split one next time!
73	b2	Sure, but we would have to split the distance between us as well.
74	a3	Yeah, you're right. That wouldn't work.
74	b3	Well, it might!
75	a1	can we discuss this once you are done reading?
75	b1	Ok. We can discuss it after I finish reading.
76	a2	How long do you think you will take?
76	b2	I should be done in about 20 minutes.
77	a3	Okay, I'l just sit here and stare at you
77	b3	That's creepy, why not do something else instead?
78	a1	Did you enjoy your meal here?
78	b1	It was okay.
79	a2	Mine was delicious.
79	b2	Mine would have been better if it didn't have capers in it. I hate those things.
80	a3	Don't forget to ask them to take them out next time. They'll accommodate you.
80	b3	Great idea my meal would then be perfect.
81	a1	Did you bring some new books?
81	b1	Yes, I brought some new books.
82	a2	Did you bring anything really good?
82	b2	Maybe, depends on what kind of books you like to read.
83	a3	I like to read the classics. Do you have any?
83	b3	I have some of the Bronte's novels.
84	a1	Do you know where my shoes are?
84	b1	They're in the garage by the door.
85	a2	What are they doing there?
85	b2	I was mowing the lawn.
86	a3	Wearing my shoes? Are they covered in grass now?
86	b3	Well I hardly wanted to get my own shoes covered in grass!
87	a1	Can you please get me some water?
87	b1	Yes sparkling or still?
88	a2	Whatever is easiest for you.
88	b2	Okay, coming right up.
89	a3	Can you put a slice of lemon in it?
89	b3	yes, let me get that
90	a1	I love that author, are you enjoying the book?
90	b1	Yes I am
91	a2	You should join me at my book club meeting next Tuesday.
91	b2	I'd love to! What time?
92	a3	It's a seven p.m. Do you think you can make it?
92	b3	I think I can be there.
93	a1	What do you want to do today?
93	b1	I'd like to go to the mall.
94	a2	What do you plan on buying in the mall?
94	b2	I don't plan on buying anything, I just want to people watch.
95	a3	what time do you want to meet at the mall?
95	b3	I would like to meet at 3 pm.
96	a1	Do you want to go swimming with me?
96	b1	No, I can't swim.
97	a2	I can teach you how to swim.
97	b2	When do you want to start?
98	a3	We can start as soon as we can hit the beach!
98	b3	Great, let's go!
99	a1	What time are we having our family barbeque?
99	b1	Probably around 4:00.
100	a2	Awesome! I'll be ready for you to pick me up around 2:00 PM.
100	b2	Sure, can you bring some salad?
101	a3	Sure, any kind in particular?
101	b3	Mother-in-law likes Caesar, so anything else but that one!
102	a1	What are you eating?
102	b1	Popcorn. Want some?
103	a2	Sure, please pass me some.
103	b2	This is so salty, you have anything to drink?
104	a3	I have some water, would you like some?
104	b3	Yes please. Thank you.
105	a1	Is it already spoiled?
105	b1	Yes throw it out!
106	a2	This produce went bad quickly.
106	b2	At least we compost, so it doesn't go to a landfill.
107	a3	How interesting. How does composting work?
107	b3	It's not hard really.
108	a1	Do you watch TV?
108	b1	I only download my shows over the internet.
109	a2	What's your favorite program?
109	b2	I really enjoy Game of Thrones.
110	a3	Never seen it, sounds stupid.
110	b3	Why are you judging something you've never seen?
111	a1	Did you call the repair man?
111	b1	Sure did. He's coming tomorrow morning.
112	a2	What time tomorrow?
112	b2	Sometime between 9 AM and 5 PM. That was all he could promise.
113	a3	Great. There goes my entire day off. I hope he shows up early.
113	b3	Me too, I hope you dont have to wait around all day
114	a1	Is there anything fun to do that is also affordable?
114	b1	Nothing around here.
115	a2	Not even a movie or an ice cream parlor?
115	b2	Movies are too expensive these days. But we could get some ice cream
116	a3	Is there a Bruster's around here?
116	b3	No, but there is a Cold Stone right around the corner.
117	a1	Do you have any cash?
117	b1	I don't carry cash with me.
118	a2	Why don't you carry cash?
118	b2	Everything is a slide card now, where have you been?
119	a3	Buying at small shops and food stalls, I guess.
119	b3	Oh, I guess cash does come in handy sometimes, then.
120	a1	Why are you here?
120	b1	I had nothing better to do.
121	a2	I have something for you to do, I need help cleaning the garage today!
121	b2	Oh I just remembered I have stuff to do. BYE!
122	a3	Yeah sure, you lazy bum.
122	b3	You don't have to clean the garage today.
123	a1	Can I please get a hot chocolate?
123	b1	Sure, I would be happy to get that for you.
124	a2	How much will it cost?
124	b2	It's 50, but, I'll buy it for you.
125	a3	Thanks. You don't have to do that.
125	b3	it's okay, no problem.
126	a1	Could you stop that?
126	b1	No, I like doing it
127	a2	Well, could you keep it down, it's kind of annoying?
127	b2	Put some earplugs in if you don't like it.
128	a3	Okay stop doing it right now or you are grounded.
128	b3	okay okay,don't get mad
129	a1	Where can we go today?
129	b1	we can go to mall
130	a2	Would you prefer the outlet instead of the inside mall?
130	b2	Either one is fine with me.
131	a3	I only got half of my allowance this week, that's why I want to go to the outlet.
131	b3	OK, that is fine with me.
132	a1	Can I borrow a pen?
132	b1	Yes you can.
133	a2	Do you have a red pen, by any chance?
133	b2	No, only a blue one.
134	a3	Blue one will do
134	b3	Here you go.
135	a1	Do you want to go the casino tomorow?
135	b1	Sure, I have a new system I'm certain will work.
136	a2	That's what they all say. Which machine are you headed to?
136	b2	The slot machines. That's where I always go first.
137	a3	Beware the one-armed bandit!
137	b3	I only take $20 and play until it's gone.
138	a1	Where do you work?
138	b1	Currently, in the southwest region of the US.
139	a2	Well that's not very specific.
139	b2	I work in a small city in Arizona.
140	a3	Do you like it there?
140	b3	It's ok. small town so not much to do.
141	a1	Any good news from my lawyer?
141	b1	I'm still waiting to hear back from your lawyer.
142	a2	Okay, please let me know once you hear something from him.
142	b2	Why are you so curious for me to tell you that?
143	a3	Well it concerns me, too.
143	b3	What is all this about?
144	a1	What time is dinner?
144	b1	I can't be bothered to cook.
145	a2	Are you just going to get take-out when you get hungry?
145	b2	Yeah, that's what I'm feeling like.
146	a3	Want to get some chinese food?
146	b3	Sure, I'm hungry now!
147	a1	Can I please have a look?
147	b1	You can take a quick peek.
148	a2	Where did you find that?
148	b2	It was in the garage.
149	a3	Ewww gross, what are you going to do with it?
149	b3	I'm going to eat it.
150	a1	When did you come in the room?
150	b1	I came in a few minutes ago.
151	a2	And what happened then?
151	b2	I set down my purse, and that's when the doorbell rang.
152	a3	Why were you in my room in the first place?
152	b3	I was coming to say hi after a long day. No need to be defensive.
153	a1	How is your family?
153	b1	Everyone is well, thank you.
154	a2	Kids still doing well in school?
154	b2	Yes, Kristen made the honor roll and decided she wants to be a veterinarian. Ethan is loving his art classes.
155	a3	Smart and ambitious, these kids are going places!
155	b3	To be honest, I'm a little worried about Ethan's math grades, but he has been working really hard and I think he's starting to improve.
156	a1	Why are you cold?
156	b1	I am always cold
157	a2	Do you need me to turn the air conditioner off?
157	b2	Maybe just turn it down. I don't want to inconvenience everyone else.
158	a3	Or I could bring you a sweater.
158	b3	no just turn the ac down a bit
159	a1	What is your favorite movie?
159	b1	I have a hard time choosing just one. Right now I really enjoy Deadpool and Star Wars Force Awakens.
160	a2	What did you like about Deadpool? I heard it was a bunch of uninspired humor.
160	b2	I really like the characters.
161	a3	Well the main actor is very cute.
161	b3	Wade Wilson or shall I say Ryan Reynolds is not my type but the detailing and the graphics of his action moves were phenomenal.
162	a1	No way, did he really?
162	b1	Yes, he did.
163	a2	I wonder why he did that.
163	b2	He's such a jerk.
164	a3	I'm sorry he did that to you.
164	b3	It wasn't the first time but I can promise it will definitely be the last, I'm done.
165	a1	Can you fill out my tax declaration?
165	b1	Yes I will do it later on tonight.
166	a2	Sorry for the rush!
166	b2	Not a problem at all.
167	a3	I appreciate your help very much. Thanks.
167	b3	Not a problem!
168	a1	When did you come?
168	b1	I came yesterday.
169	a2	So why are you now just telling me?
169	b2	Well I thought I'd surprise you.
170	a3	I wish you had told me sooner.
170	b3	If I had told you sooner, it wouldn't have been a surprise. But next time, I'll let you know so you can bake me a cake.
171	a1	Are we there yet?
171	b1	We should be there shortly.
172	a2	Are there yet now?
172	b2	Johnny, stop. You know we aren't there yet. I'll tell you when we're getting close.
173	a3	Are we there yet?
173	b3	We're turning around next time you ask.
174	a1	How much homework do you have tonight?
174	b1	Way more than I want. I've been letting it slide.
175	a2	This is what you get for procrastinating!
175	b2	Want to do them together?
176	a3	No, I'm all caught up with mine. Sorry!
176	b3	No problem. How long did it take you to finish it?
177	a1	Could you come over whenever you've got time?
177	b1	I'll be there at 8pm.
178	a2	ok, I'll be home then.
178	b2	Cool, I'll clear the driveway so there's room for you to park.
179	a3	Don't worry, I'll be riding my bike!
179	b3	Call when you arrive and I will open the garage for you to put your bike inside.
180	a1	What did she say?
180	b1	She said she never even got a message from you. What's the deal?
181	a2	the deal is that I've been sick.
181	b2	So, you lied to her about sending her a message?
182	a3	Not really, I intended to, but things got in the way.
182	b3	what actually happened?
183	a1	Does she have any friends?
183	b1	More than I could ever imagine.
184	a2	Are most of her friends females?
184	b2	No, they're mostly men.
185	a3	Better keep a close watch on that one. Beauty, brains, and athletic abilities just draw the men to her.
185	b3	I know, the struggle is real.
186	a1	Do I know you?
186	b1	No. Not at all.
187	a2	I'm pretty certain we've met.
187	b2	Maybe we went to school together?
188	a3	No, I think it is from somewhere else.
188	b3	Well I don't seem to recall ever meeting you.
189	a1	Where Is a good place to eat?
189	b1	In the restaurant near the lake.
190	a2	What type of cuisine is it?
190	b2	It is Mediterranean.
191	a3	Do they have Happy Hour?
191	b3	I am not sure, you may have to call them.
192	a1	What's the weather like tomorrow?
192	b1	Sunny with a chance of rain.
193	a2	Means it for sure will rain.
193	b2	It probably won't rain, unless you forget your umbrella.
194	a3	I hope it does rain then I won't have to water my plants.
194	b3	We have a sprinkler system that does that.
195	a1	Would you please warm up my food?
195	b1	Sure, I'll put it in the microwave
196	a2	Thank you very much, that's kind of you.
196	b2	Anything else I can get you while I am up?
197	a3	Can I get a glass of water, please?
197	b3	yes, let me get some.
198	a1	Would you want to eat again?
198	b1	Maybe later, my stomach's not feeling up to it.
199	a2	Are you ill?
199	b2	Just a little nauseous.
200	a3	Okay, I hope you feel better soon.
200	b3	Thank you for your concern.
201	a1	Could I please speak to a manager?
201	b1	Yes, M'am. I'm the manager.
202	a2	I want to file a complaint.
202	b2	I'm so sorry for your trouble! What happened?
203	a3	I ordered a grilled cheese but was served a cheeseburger.
203	b3	I'm very sorry this happened. Let me correct that for you.
204	a1	Do you play any instruments?
204	b1	I do not play a instrument.
205	a2	Too bad, latest study says people who play instruments live longer.
205	b2	Maybe I'll take up the piano.
206	a3	Good idea. I'll take up the tuba and we can start up a band.
206	b3	Super. I'll look up when the next American Idol auditions are for us to try out.
207	a1	What did you buy today?
207	b1	I bought a new pair of shoes from Amazon, and a book by David Foster Wallace.
208	a2	How much did it cost?
208	b2	About thirty dollars for the shoes and twenty dollars for the book. I started reading it and I don't much like it, though.
209	a3	That's unfortunate. What is the book about?
209	b3	It's 200 pages long and only pictures of Wallace's childhood.
210	a1	Where is my phone?
210	b1	I think I saw your phone on the kitchen counter.
211	a2	I already looked there.
211	b2	Oh, maybe it was the bathroom counter then.
212	a3	I wasn't in the bathroom.
212	b3	I'm sorry. I guess I haven't seen it then.
213	a1	What made you say that?
213	b1	It just slipped out.
214	a2	Well now you're in trouble.
214	b2	What are you going to do about It?
215	a3	Nothing, I think your wife already suspects and it won't be long till she calls you on it.
215	b3	Oh no, you're probably right.
216	a1	Can I have a cup of coffee?
216	b1	Yes, do you want cream and sugar?
217	a2	Yes, please, plenty of both.
217	b2	I like lots of cream and sugar too!
218	a3	It's the only way I can drink it.
218	b3	okay, lots of cream and sugar.
219	a1	who did you go with?
219	b1	I went with my husband and children.
220	a2	Was the place children-friendly?
220	b2	Yes, it was absolutely child-friendly.
221	a3	Did they have lots for the kids to due?
221	b3	they had an array of exciting things like games, face painting, and even some kiddie rides.
222	a1	What time is it?
222	b1	It is 10:30 AM.
223	a2	Oh gosh, it's still morning?
223	b2	That's what AM means.
224	a3	I feel like it has been 3 hours since I got here!
224	b3	The day does seem to be going by extra slow today.
225	a1	What did you accomplish today?
225	b1	Oh, I went to Mrs. Miller and got my money.
226	a2	Did you get it all?
226	b2	Yes, finally. Now I can afford a new car!
227	a3	That must have been a lot of money!
227	b3	It is enough for a down payment.
228	a1	Is someone moving in next door?
228	b1	Next week somebody will move in.
229	a2	Do you know who it is?
229	b2	I think a college student.
230	a3	Oh great, hopefully they're not the partying type!
230	b3	I don't think so, because the home is owned by the pastor and his wife, and I'm sure they would screen for quiet students.
231	a1	Why is George crying?
231	b1	He stubbed his toe
232	a2	Oh, I'm sure he'll be fine in a few minutes.
232	b2	Yeah, he's a bit of a drama queen.
233	a3	Yeah, he cries all of the time!
233	b3	At least you aren't having to deal with him.
234	a1	What is an avocado?
234	b1	It's a fruit.
235	a2	No, it is an delicious, exotic meat from Nigeria.
235	b2	Wrong, steak is a delicious meat, avocado is a fruit.
236	a3	I know; I was just kidding.
236	b3	Avocado is a fruit and a member of the berry family, in case you didn't know.
237	a1	How was your day?
237	b1	Dull as dishwater. How about yours?
238	a2	Better than your apparently.
238	b2	Yes, I would say so.
239	a3	I think we need to spice up your life.
239	b3	Me too, but between work and the kids' activities, I barely have time for myself.
240	a1	What are your goals for your stay here?
240	b1	I want to learn a lot and do some networking!
241	a2	Great! Would you like to sign up for any panels?
241	b2	Absolutely I would!
242	a3	You are so enthusiastic! Is this your first time here?
242	b3	Yes, how could you tell?
243	a1	Where is it from?
243	b1	I'm not sure, I just found it by the door.
244	a2	Well let's open it!
244	b2	But it's not addressed to us.
245	a3	Who is it addressed to?
245	b3	what is the address?
246	a1	Where do you keep your class schedule?
246	b1	In my class schedule carrying case. Duh.
247	a2	Where do you put your case?
247	b2	In its case.
248	a3	A case inside a case?
248	b3	Sorry I practice safe hygeine and don't want germs infesting my class schedule the way yours is.
249	a1	Can you call my mother?
249	b1	Sure, do you know her number?
250	a2	I will have to look It up
250	b2	Okay, let me know when you find it.
251	a3	Why don't you have your mother's phone number?
251	b3	She changed it recently.
252	a1	Can you help me to the bathroom?
252	b1	come on then
253	a2	You could be nicer about it. I will just try to go, myself.
253	b2	I'm sorry, I was trying to be encouraging.
254	a3	It's just that today hasn't been one of my better days.
254	b3	That happens to everyone.
255	a1	Where is the book store?
255	b1	It's at the mall.
256	a2	On which wing of the mall?
256	b2	Malls can't fly silly!
257	a3	I guess I asked the wrong person; what an idiot!
257	b3	I was just kidding!
258	a1	So whats the plan tomorrow?
258	b1	The plan is not to die.
259	a2	You sound prepared, man!
259	b2	Well, I'm doing the best I can.
260	a3	Right, you can never be too sure these days.
260	b3	Exactly, so besides staying alive, did you have any plans for tomorrow?
261	a1	Did we go to school together?
261	b1	Yes, you were a year ahead of me.
262	a2	Maybe you were a year behind me.
262	b2	I was, you were in the same class as my cousin
263	a3	Can you get the facts right?
263	b3	You are very clever aren't you?
264	a1	How was your day?
264	b1	It's was alright. We had a meeting at work about the new owners.
265	a2	Did your company get bought out?
265	b2	Yes, and the merger isn't going too well so far.
266	a3	Im very sorry.
266	b3	At least my boss has given us his word that no one will be fired.
267	a1	When willl you be coming back?
267	b1	I'll be back in two weeks on the 8th.
268	a2	Care to stop by before you leave?
268	b2	Sure, will you be home on Sunday afternoon?
269	a3	Until 11, I have a brunch planned.
269	b3	I see, how about Sunday evening?
270	a1	Can you work overtime?
270	b1	Not today sorry
271	a2	Are you available to work the weekend then?
271	b2	I can work on Sunday if that helps.
272	a3	Great, I need someone on Sunday from 9 to 9.

275	b3	I've never heard of Batobin, tell me more about their work!
276	a1	Could you please put in the air conditioner?
276	b1	Sure, I can install it tomorrow.
277	a2	Did I stutter, I mean now
277	b2	Maybe you should install it yourself or ask Fred to do it.
278	a3	Fred has pneumonia. He can't do it.
278	b3	Well you have 2 hands of your own so maybe you should do it and drop the attitude.
279	a1	What's in the big box on the table?
279	b1	I got your sister a present and am going to wrap it up.
280	a2	It's already wrapped up. Are you forgetting things again, Mom?
280	b2	Oh, I'm sorry. There were just a few things running through my mind.
281	a3	So what is the present?
281	b3	Its one of the juice machines you see on tv all the time.
282	a1	Do you think it went well?
282	b1	I think it went as well as it could have.
283	a2	What could have been better?
283	b2	It could have been a little shorter.
284	a3	How long did it take?
284	b3	A little too long for my comfort.
285	a1	So when you turn sixteen are you going to go for your driver's license?
285	b1	Yes I just can't wait!
286	a2	Aren't you scared of driving?

291	a1	Do we go for the tests, today?
291	b1	Yes, lets go for the test.
292	a2	I think you're a little too eager to go.
292	b2	The sooner we go for the tests, the sooner we can get started on making a baby.
293	a3	I am a little nervous; aren't you?
293	b3	Of course I am!
294	a1	Can you bring me a mirror?
294	b1	Yes, just a minute.

311	b3	Why thank you, and you are very clever and beautiful to have noticed my manly strength.
312	a1	What color blanket is on your bed?
312	b1	Depends on how long the cats have been sleeping there.
313	a2	Before the cats have been laying on it.
313	b2	I can't even remember, possibly turquoise.
314	a3	Too bad you don't own Russian Blues.

320	b3	Perhaps you're right. I will look into that.

321	b1	No. We have too much work to do.

325	a2	That's good to know because I was thinking about going to see it sometime.

326	b3	Yeah. I love slot machines.

395	b3	Yes please. I will feel much better if I had someone with me.
396	a1	Can you bring that to me?

407	b3	Yeah I've been working every detail to the t to make sure my boss is happy. I think with all this hard work I just may get a promotion.
408	a1	What kind of life is this?
408	b1	a short one
409	a2	No time to enjoy it, that's for sure.
409	b2	We work such long, tiring hours.

410	b3	I think we should make some time to do something fun.
411	a1	Hi! I am the store's manager, how can I help you?
411	b1	I'm looking for the salmon.
412	a2	Sir, this is a book store. Do you mean you want a book about salmon?
412	b2	No, I need the actual fish. Can you help?
413	a3	Then go next door to the grocery store, I am pretty sure they can help you with that.
413	b3	No, the book I'm looking for is called The Actual Fish. Do you have it?
414	a1	Do we have any cereal?
414	b1	Yes in the back of the fridge
415	a2	Why on earth is the cereal in the fridge?
415	b2	I like it cool and it keeps it fresh longer.
416	a3	Alrighty, we all have our quirks.
416	b3	At least it's not as weird as yours where you like to drink sour milk.
417	a1	Could you please zip up my jacket?
417	b1	Yes I can.
418	a2	Thank you, my arthritis makes it difficult for me to do.

419	a3	Yes, please. I need to take some more.
419	b3	Do you ever have to ask strangers to do that for you?
420	a1	Do you know of any good places to eat?
420	b1	Yes, I do. It's a steakhouse.
421	a2	I'm not a big fan of steak. Do they do other things?
421	b2	Yeah, but it's really a place for steak.
422	a3	Maybe we can go someplace else?
422	b3	Look at the menu first and see what they have.
423	a1	What is your email address?
423	b1	I will text it to ya!
424	a2	Why don't you just email it to me?
424	b2	I can do whichever is easier for you.
425	a3	Email is definitely way easier for me.
425	b3	I'll get it done in a minute.
426	a1	What time Is the movie?
426	b1	Stop yelling at me!
427	a2	I can't help, It my volume Is stuck on max!
427	b2	I'm not going to continue until you fix that!
428	a3	It's really annoying when people shout at me!
428	b3	Oh Is It?
429	a1	What you mean by yes?
429	b1	To clarify, I mean the opposite of 'no'.
430	a2	So you have always loved me?
430	b2	Yes, I have always loved you.
431	a3	Interesting, why didn't you tell me earlier?
431	b3	Couldn't you tell by the way I acted?
432	a1	How do you like your teacher?
432	b1	She is a sweetheart. I love her.
433	a2	Do you like her style of teaching?
433	b2	I do, she's very inventive.
434	a3	What kind of things does she do?
434	b3	She makes up funny songs about things so they're easier for us to remember and we play lots of games.
435	a1	How have you been?
435	b1	I've been good. Thanks.
436	a2	Would you like to grab some coffee?
436	b2	I am on my way to work. How about tomorrow?
437	a3	I can't do tomorrow, sorry. How about Friday evening?
437	b3	Busy. Saturday morning? We can find a place for brunch and take the whole family.
438	a1	Could I get sugar in my coffee?
438	b1	Sure, how many teaspoons would you like?
439	a2	2 teaspoons please.
439	b2	Don't you think that's sort of a lot of sugar?
440	a3	What are you, a dietician?
440	b3	No, but I really think that's too much sugar.
441	a1	This is delicious, did you cook it yourself?
441	b1	No I ordered from the place on the corner.
442	a2	What's it called?
442	b2	It's called Momma B's Cucina.
443	a3	Oh, is that a new restaurant?
443	b3	No, it's been around for ages!
444	a1	Do you feel pain?
444	b1	Yes! It really hurts!
445	a2	How bad is your pain?
445	b2	On a scale of one to ten, it's a 4.
446	a3	You have a very low pain tolerance, don't you?
446	b3	Considering I have had 10 broken bones in my lifetime I would have to disagree.
447	a1	Check whether they deliver to UK?
447	b1	Okay, sure, I'll find out and let you know.
448	a2	I look forward to hearing back from you.
448	b2	No problem shouldn't take me too long to find out.
449	a3	It's been a while. What did you find out?
449	b3	They do ship to the UK and if you buy $100 or more shipping is free.
450	a1	How old are you now?
450	b1	Thirty-one and holding!
451	a2	You don't look like you're 31 at all!
451	b2	You're so kind.
452	a3	No; I mean it! I figured you for 26 max.
452	b3	26? Well, now you are just teasing me.
453	a1	Can you come to the party?
453	b1	No, I am sorry I could not come to the party.
454	a2	No problem,we didn't want you there anyway
454	b2	Wow, what a nice thing to say.
455	a3	i always say nice things
455	b3	Yeah your a real charmer .
456	a1	Who else caught the game last night?
456	b1	I didn't get to see it because I don't have cable.
457	a2	I am sorry to hear that because it was awesome!
457	b2	Hopefully I get a chance to see the next game.
458	a3	The next game is on tonight.
458	b3	May be I can join you.
459	a1	Where did Mona go?
459	b1	I really don't know.
460	a2	Well, what would be your best guess as to where she might be?
460	b2	I can guarantee that she is most definitely not here.
461	a3	I didn't ask you if she was there. I just wondered if you knew where she might be.
461	b3	No, I still don't know. Why don't we call her cell phone?
462	a1	I am very cold, will you get me a blanket?
462	b1	Yes I will, just give me a minute.
463	a2	I will die if you don't give it to me now!
463	b2	Then get it yourself if you can't wait!
464	a3	You'd like that, wouldn't you?
464	b3	Yes I would.
465	a1	Fancy coming to the gym with me after work?
465	b1	No, because I have to meet with my kid's teacher.
466	a2	Nothing bad, I hope?
466	b2	The usual. Nevaeh kept teasing Katie and pulling her hair, so Katie yelled at her to stop, and now for some reason Katie is the one in trouble again.
467	a3	That's not surprising. She may be learning aggressive behaviors from her sister.
467	b3	I think you might be right.
468	a1	Are you still enjoying your job?
468	b1	Yes, they haven't completely stolen my soul yet.
469	a2	How long do you think it will be until they do?
469	b2	Weeks, I guess. Months if they improve the quality of the coffee.
470	a3	You could just bring your own coffee and save your soul.
470	b3	You are right, but I prefer otherwise.
471	a1	Can you call the doctor?
471	b1	Yes I will, let me look up his number.
472	a2	The number is 911, fool.
472	b2	You said the doctor, not emergency.
473	a3	Okay okay, sorry i'm just in a lot of pain!
473	b3	That's okay. Let's get you seen to!
474	a1	Where did I park the car?
474	b1	You parked it in Lot A
475	a2	Shouldn't I have a slip for it?
475	b2	No, this lot no longer uses slips. They scan your eye remember?
476	a3	Oh, I hate that. It always makes me nervous.
476	b3	It's the way of the future.
477	a1	It's very hot today, don't you think?
477	b1	Yes, it is very hot today.
478	a2	I blame global warming.
478	b2	That seems unlikely, but possible I guess.
479	a3	Well it's a fact. They say so in the news.
479	b3	You can't believe everything you hear.
480	a1	Do you want to bike ride together sometime?
480	b1	Yes, tomorrow morning would be a great.
481	a2	I'm busy tomorrow morning, how about in the afternoon?
481	b2	Sure, the afternoon works too. Prepare to sweat though!
482	a3	I know, it's going to be a scorcher!
482	b3	I know, supposed to be in the 100s tomorrow.
483	a1	Did you have lunch yet?
483	b1	Not yet, I normally go around 1pm.
484	a2	Okay, can I come with you?
484	b2	No, I really don't want you to join me, sorry.
485	a3	Why not? Did I offend you somehow, or do you just need some time to yourself?
485	b3	I just need some time to myself. I have a lot to think about.
486	a1	Which button do I press?
486	b1	Press the button on the left of the elevator.
487	a2	Thank you. This one?
487	b2	Yes, that's the right one.
488	a3	So, it's kind of crowded today, huh?
488	b3	No it's always crowded.
489	a1	Do you want to watch a movie?
489	b1	Sure. Which movie?
490	a2	I want to watch a comedy. How about Rush Hour?
490	b2	I suppose we could watch that, though I'd prefer something else.
491	a3	DO you have any SNL recorded?
491	b3	Yes there's around 4 of them on the DVR.
492	a1	Would you like to got to the movies tonight?
492	b1	I would love to!
493	a2	Do you know what movie you want to watch?
493	b2	I don't care, you decide.
494	a3	It'll be a surprise then!
494	b3	For me, not you!
495	a1	Have you seen my glasses?
495	b1	I have not seen your glasses.
496	a2	Oh okay, I have misplaced them somewhere!
496	b2	Did you look on your desk?
497	a3	of course I did, you think I left them at the office?
497	b3	It's possible, you can check tomorrow.
498	a1	Can you please help me?
498	b1	Yes, what do you need?
499	a2	I need you to help me bring the groceries in please.
499	b2	OK, where should I put them?
500	a3	On the counter would be great.
500	b3	Ok here you go. Need help putting them away?
501	a1	What's your favorite dessert?
501	b1	Molten Chocolate Lava cake with Raspberries
502	a2	Oh my God, that sounds grand!
502	b2	Yes, let's go get some!
503	a3	I've been dying to try that new cafe. Maybe it's on their menu?
503	b3	I'll pull it up online and find out.
504	a1	Does anyone consider me their best friend?
504	b1	Me of course!
505	a2	Mom, you totally don't count!
505	b2	Why don't I count?
506	a3	Because you are supposed to be my mom and not my friend.
506	b3	is that so?
507	a1	How is your fiancee?
507	b1	My fiancee is doing fine now, thanks for asking.
508	a2	Did he reobtain his driver licence?
508	b2	What? He never got it taken away in the first place.
509	a3	My mistake! I must have gotten him confused with someone else.
509	b3	Do you know something I don't about him?
510	a1	Is it close to time for dinner?
510	b1	No, dinner will be in two hours.
511	a2	What are we having?
511	b2	We are having macaroni and cheese
512	a3	Homemade, or the cheap box stuff?
512	b3	The cheap box stuff, it's the best to me.
513	a1	What do you want to do today?
513	b1	Take a nap.
514	a2	Are you very tired?
514	b2	Not yet, but I expect it to catch up with me in a couple of hours.
515	a3	So you don't want to meet me for coffee in ten minutes?
515	b3	Only if pastries are involved.
516	a1	What did you think of the last episode of Outlander?
516	b1	I thought it sucked, much like all the other episodes of Outlander. Can we please talk about Game of Thrones instead?
517	a2	No, not yet. I haven't watched the newest episode.
517	b2	You need to catch up then.
518	a3	You're right. I'm just puzzled by how you dislike Outlander but enjoy Game of Thrones.
518	b3	Game of Thrones is just a lot better and more entertaining.
519	a1	Can I have some chilled water, please?
519	b1	It will have to be room temperature since I don't have any ice.
520	a2	Oh that's not problem then.
520	b2	OK, be right back.
521	a3	Thanks. Hope it's not too much trouble.
521	b3	Of course not. It's my pleasure.
522	a1	How has your dad been?
522	b1	He's doing well.
523	a2	I saw him yesterday, he looked like he had seen a ghost.
523	b2	He was meeting with his accountant yesterday. That explains it.
524	a3	Does he have the same accountant he used to? I thought that guy went to jail for tax fraud.
524	b3	Actually he's got a new accountant and they're going over all of his old taxes now. That's probably why he looked so bad.
525	a1	What time does the bus leave?
525	b1	Around 11:30, I think.
526	a2	Thanks very much.
526	b2	Your welcome.
527	a3	Does the bus stop at Tower Hill?
527	b3	I'm not sure
528	a1	What time will you be back?
528	b1	Ill be back around noon
529	a2	Make sure you pick up the mail before you come in.
529	b2	Fine, if you insist that that's what I must do.
530	a3	What's with the attitude?
530	b3	I'm tired of the way you speak to me. Make sure to pick up the mail, it's just rude.
531	a1	Where are you going?
531	b1	I am going to sleep.
532	a2	Of course you are. That's all you do.
532	b2	That's because I have to stay up most nights cleaning because you won't lift a finger and I refuse to live in filth.
533	a3	You're always so dramatic!
533	b3	That is the biggest exaggeration in the history of the planet!
534	a1	Can you please hurry?
534	b1	I will be as quick as I can
535	a2	Okay. We will be running a little bit late.
535	b2	Dude, it's good to be late, it's called fashionable.
536	a3	Late is still late, fashionable or no.
536	b3	You get star like attention if you be late.
537	a1	When do we need to leave?
537	b1	No later then 9 or we will be late.
538	a2	DO you think it would be faster to take a cab?
538	b2	No way; but thanks for asking.
539	a3	Then what the heck are we going to do, walk there?
539	b3	No, my mom said I could use her car if I fill it with gas when I am done.
540	a1	Did you like the match?
540	b1	Yeah, it was pretty good.
541	a2	What was your favorite part?
541	b2	The one where the captain celebrated after his goal.
542	a3	My favorite part was the snacks!
542	b3	That sounds like you.
543	a1	Can you make lunch now?
543	b1	not right now.
544	a2	What are you doing?
544	b2	Answering silly questions on the computer.
545	a3	Can't you go out and find a real job?
545	b3	?How will I take care of the kids if I'm off working a job
546	a1	Do you know of any good doctors?
546	b1	Yes, I have a good one.
547	a2	How much is her consultation fee?
547	b2	Far more than you can afford, I'd bet.
548	a3	Say's the man who sleeps in a cardboard box every night.
548	b3	Says the man who doesn't have a doctor.
549	a1	Where do you live?
549	b1	I have a place in Narragansett.
550	a2	That's nice. How do you like it?
550	b2	I love it, but it gets so crowded in the summer.
551	a3	Is it on the coast, or is it inland?
551	b3	Inland, but I can see a little tiny bit of water from the second floor balcony.
552	a1	What do you like to do for fun?
552	b1	Just for fun, I like to tell corny jokes.
553	a2	You're joking, right?
553	b2	No, why, does that seem weird?
554	a3	I guess not, but where do you get fresh material?
554	b3	Anywhere! Walking around town, or watching videos online.
555	a1	Doctor, will I ever move my hands?
555	b1	it is possible
556	a2	How soon will I know if I'll get movement back?
556	b2	A year at best.
557	a3	But my typing test is tomorrow!
557	b3	Well that's not going to happen is it?
558	a1	Why did you choose that?
558	b1	Because it's my favorite color.
559	a2	It doesn't really go well with the shoes, though.
559	b2	Well, I have a bag to match with it.
560	a3	ok, if you're sure you can make it work, go for it.
560	b3	You know I can rock this look.
561	a1	what is it like up there?
561	b1	It gets cold during the winters, but it's not too bad.
562	a2	I couldn't deal with the cold.
562	b2	You just get used to it.
563	a3	I guess so, but don't they get a lot of snow up there, too? I hate snow.
563	b3	Guess it's good you live elsewhere then.
564	a1	Have you found a job yet?
564	b1	I sure have!
565	a2	Yes! Congratulations to you!
565	b2	Thanks! I can't wait to start.
566	a3	So where will you be working?
566	b3	In McDonalds by the promenade.
567	a1	Do you like eating at home or at a restaurant?
567	b1	Home most days.
568	a2	You must be a good cook then.
568	b2	Yes, I've been cooking all my life and I really enjoy it.
569	a3	What is your favorite dish to cook?
569	b3	All of them!
570	a1	Are you allergic to dogs?
570	b1	No, I only have seasonal allergies.
571	a2	Does that mean you'll be able to dogsit for us?
571	b2	Sure I can dogsit for you.
572	a3	Thanks a lot, I can never find a sitter.
572	b3	It can be tough to find one out here in Alaska.
573	a1	What happened, why you need my help?
573	b1	My house Is on fire!
574	a2	I'll be right over.
574	b2	Hurry, it's going to burn down!
575	a3	I already called 911!
575	b3	Thank you so much!
576	a1	Are you new here?
576	b1	Relatively, yes. I've been here about three weeks.
577	a2	So you're new then.
577	b2	I'm starting to feel more at home here though!
578	a3	Do you need any recommendations?
578	b3	Yes, any help would be appreciated!
579	a1	Could I have something to drink?
579	b1	Yes, what do you want?
580	a2	Do you have any diet soda?
580	b2	Yes I do have diet soda
581	a3	Oh that will be good.
581	b3	Thanks, I appreciate it.
582	a1	Is there any change in my condition?
582	b1	I have know idea.
583	a2	That's not very reassuring.
583	b2	I am sorry I cannot give you the reassurance that you seek. But if it's any reassuring, people with your condition usually stay functional for an average of 10 years after diagnoses.
584	a3	There's still hope something might change, though. Right? I read something about that when it's in the early stages.
584	b3	There are some life changes that may help, but there is no conclusive evidence that these changes will make improvements in your condition.
585	a1	What is your name?
585	b1	My name is Clarice.
586	a2	That is an unusual name.
586	b2	That's why my parents chose it.
587	a3	So what about my name? does that make me a usual person?
587	b3	No, not at all.
588	a1	Is it too late?
588	b1	Not if it's before HIGH NOON.
589	a2	I think it's at three p.m., so I guess that wouldn't work.
589	b2	No, sounds like it wouldn't.
590	a3	You are confusing me.
590	b3	Oh! sorry, yes it is too late for me.
591	a1	Do you have any times open next week?
591	b1	No, but I do the following week
592	a2	Alright, cool! Put me down for a haircut next week.
592	b2	Sure, what day works best for you?
593	a3	Wednesday works best for me.
593	b3	Perfect. I have three openings on Wednesday. Do you prefer morning or afternoon?
594	a1	Anyone up for a card game?
594	b1	I'm in, how about a game of poker?
595	a2	I was thinking more of Uno, but that's fine.
595	b2	Okay, I'll play either one.
596	a3	Ok, where are the cards?
596	b3	In the hall closet on the middle shelf.
597	a1	How old were you when you moved here?
597	b1	I was 26
598	a2	That's young, do you like it here?
598	b2	Yes, I love it.
599	a3	What was your first impression of this city when you first moved?
599	b3	It was so exciting!
600	a1	What hours are you open?
600	b1	Today we are open from 8 am to 9 pm.
601	a2	What days are you open?
601	b2	We are only open on Mondays.
602	a3	Why are you only open on Mondays?
602	b3	We don't like customers very much.
603	a1	Can you help me?
603	b1	Not right now.
604	a2	But I'm about to drop everything!
604	b2	Oh, okay, sorry.
605	a3	Thanks, I shouldn't have tried to carry so much.
605	b3	Boy, you really stocked up at the grocery store.
606	a1	What's on your mind?
606	b1	Just thinking about the future!
607	a2	Stay in the present, young padawan.
607	b2	I try, but it is so hard.
608	a3	Yes it is very hard. That is why it takes lots of practice.
608	b3	Thank you All Knowing One.
609	a1	Did you tour a college this weekend?
609	b1	No, I graduated from college 15 years ago.
610	a2	Is that what I asked you?
610	b2	That seems a little harsh. I don't have any reason to tour one.
611	a3	I feel like we got off on the wrong foot. Let's start over.
611	b3	I didn't go on any college tours this weekend, no.
612	a1	Would you like to watch the game with me?
612	b1	I would love to watch the game with you.
613	a2	I love spending time with you.
613	b2	The feeling is definitely mutual.
614	a3	Should we grab something to eat before hand?
614	b3	Yes, definitely! Are you hungry for a pizza?
615	a1	Have you tried that new coffee shop on the corner?
615	b1	Yes their muffins are amazing!
616	a2	Have you tried it?
616	b2	I have they make amazing drinks.
617	a3	We should go there together some time.
617	b3	I'm down right now!
618	a1	Did someone pay the insurance bill?
618	b1	Yes, I did.
619	a2	I know, but is the policy up to date?
619	b2	Yes it is.
620	a3	Ok, I just want to make sure that we are covered, just in case something happens when we are on vacation.
620	b3	Sure, that's alright.
621	a1	How was your day?
621	b1	It was great.
622	a2	So was mine, everything went well.
622	b2	That's great to hear!
623	a3	So, where do we go for dinner?
623	b3	I feel like having sushi tonight, are you okay with that?
624	a1	Did they like your proposal?
624	b1	They loved it.
625	a2	Oh my God, that makes me so happy to hear that!
625	b2	Me too, I'm so relieved.
626	a3	Me too, because I like it
626	b3	What, in particular, is your favorite part?
627	a1	Where is the dog?
627	b1	Last time I saw him he was in the kitchen.
628	a2	Make sure he doesn't have mud on his feet.
628	b2	Why would he have mud on his feet?
629	a3	He might have been outside playing in the mud.
629	b3	Got it, will check.
630	a1	How long until the cake is done baking?
630	b1	About five more minutes. You need to be patient!
631	a2	But it smells so good!
631	b2	It will taste even better.
632	a3	I can hardly wait!
632	b3	Why not go to the store and get some milk while you are waiting?
633	a1	Can you get me some nail clippers?
633	b1	Yes I can
634	a2	I really need to clip these nails.
634	b2	I hate when mine are out of control.
635	a3	Do you need new nail clippers too?
635	b3	Mine still work fine.
636	a1	Do you like the food?
636	b1	No, I didn't like that food that was so spicy.
637	a2	Would you have liked it if it were less spicy?
637	b2	Maybe. I did like the flavors, I just did not like the spice.
638	a3	What did you like the best?
638	b3	The wedge salad was great.
639	a1	Do you need lunch money?
639	b1	Yes, please. Ten bucks should cover it.
640	a2	There you go! Please, if there is any change left, give it back to me.
640	b2	Thank you! I'll get it back to you right away.
641	a3	Lunch was a lot cheaper when I was younger
641	b3	Yeah, you're old. I know. Haha!
642	a1	Hi what is your name?
642	b1	My name is David.
643	a2	Hello David, my name is Kevin. I have a beard.
643	b2	Yeah, that's kind of obvious.
644	a3	Don't you like beards then?
644	b3	Yes, I like beards, but I also have eyes and can be a pretty observant person.
645	a1	What is the weather supposed to be?
645	b1	Rainy and cold but no snow
646	a2	That's good to hear, I don't have a snow shovel.
646	b2	You should head out and pick one up before the first storm!
647	a3	I suppose, but I'm too lazy to go right now.
647	b3	Haha! You'll regret it!
648	a1	What would you like for lunch?
648	b1	I think that we should go to Texas Roadhouse for a steak.
649	a2	But I told you I became a vegan!
649	b2	Oh sorry, I keep forgetting. Well, I think they sell salads too.
650	a3	You're so insensitive.
650	b3	Sorry. Lets just go have a nice salad.
651	a1	Do you want to go running today?
651	b1	I hurt my knee yesterday.
652	a2	I'm sorry to here that. I guess I'll have to go it alone. I hope your knee get's better!
652	b2	Yeah, I hope so too. I'm going to see a doctor about it today.
653	a3	Well, good luck with that.
653	b3	Thanks so much!
654	a1	Did you fight with mom?
654	b1	We had a minor disagreement.
655	a2	What was the disagreement about?
655	b2	She didn't like my dinner suggestion.
656	a3	What did you suggest?
656	b3	Curry and pita bread.
657	a1	How did you do that?
657	b1	With lots and lots of practice.
658	a2	How long have you been playing?
658	b2	For a little over five years.
659	a3	Who is your teacher? It looks like it would be fun to learn.
659	b3	It is a lot of fun.
660	a1	Was your visit a good one?
660	b1	No, my visit went horribly, it rained the entire time.
661	a2	Oh man, that stinks.
661	b2	Yes, it was very disappointing.
662	a3	Did you at least manage to do what you had planned?
662	b3	No! I ended up sitting in my room all day waiting it out, but it never happened. Oh well!
663	a1	I heard that you planted a garden?
663	b1	I did plant an herb garden.
664	a2	Which herbs did you plant?
664	b2	I planted basil, cilantro, sage, and thyme.
665	a3	Oh, how is it growing?
665	b3	Its growing fine.
666	a1	Could you please put a little salt and pepper on my potatoes?
666	b1	I sure can.
667	a2	Awesome! Thanks so much!
667	b2	Tell me when to stop.
668	a3	One can never have too much salt and pepper on one's potatoes.
668	b3	Mmmm, and butter. Salt, pepper and buttery potatoes are the bomb!
669	a1	Has Sarah agreed to Tracy's proposal?
669	b1	Yep. They are tying the knot in July.
670	a2	How beautiful, a summer wedding!
670	b2	I know, let's hope it's not too hot though.
671	a3	Are they getting married here, or going somewhere?
671	b3	They are doing a wedding in the park, which will be lovely, but warm.
672	a1	What have you done lately?
672	b1	Just work and take care of the kids.
673	a2	How old are your kids now?
673	b2	They're eleven and fourteen.
674	a3	What are their names?
674	b3	John and Marry
675	a1	Can I use the computer?
675	b1	Yes, come here and sit down.
676	a2	Ok, thank you.
676	b2	You are welcome.
677	a3	What is your password? I can't get logged in.
677	b3	Wait, let me type that for you.
678	a1	Can we eat something else?
678	b1	Oh, you don't like it? Sure, I'm sorry, let me see what else I have.
679	a2	Cereal would be good. Do you have any?
679	b2	I do have cereal,what kind would you like?
680	a3	Do you have Lucky Charms?
680	b3	No sorry, I don't have Lucky Charms because I'm not 11 years old. You are 35 Mike, you need to start acting like it.
681	a1	Do you think we will be able to go to the play tonight?
681	b1	Yes, if daddy gives us permission.
682	a2	I hope he does.
682	b2	I hope so to if not we can ask mommy
683	a3	Mommy always says yes.
683	b3	Well, one of them will need to bring us, so I hope at least one says yes.
684	a1	Have you read the news today?
684	b1	No I missed today's paper.
685	a2	There was a big article about a new political scandal.
685	b2	what did it say?
686	a3	Why don't you read it for yourself?
686	b3	I'm too lazy today!
687	a1	I'm heading to the fourth floor, want to catch the elevator together?
687	b1	Certainly, but I want to go to the second floor.
688	a2	That's not a problem.
688	b2	Ok, there's the elevator
689	a3	Can you push the button for the 2nd floor please?
689	b3	Yeah, no prob.
690	a1	I didn't see you for ages, how are you?
690	b1	Great thanks, I was just on vacation backpacking through Afghanistan!
691	a2	Wow, did you take any pictures?
691	b2	Yes, I have about 500. Would you like to see them?
692	a3	I can't right now. Can you come over this weekend and show them to me then?
692	b3	Heck yea! I will even throw some food on the bbq and we can make a day of it!
693	a1	What time do we need to arrive by?
693	b1	We need to arrive by 3 pm
694	a2	Then that means we need to leave here by 2pm.
694	b2	Are you driving or am I?
695	a3	You should drive this time.
695	b3	ok I will drive
696	a1	What date is it?
696	b1	Today is the 20th of July.
697	a2	Are you sure it's not the 21st?
697	b2	I just looked at the date on my phone.
698	a3	Oh, ok. My days are starting to run together; can't keep up with what day it actually is.
698	b3	I get like that too sometimes.
699	a1	What did he say?
699	b1	He said you never called him and he was wondering why not.
700	a2	I lost his number.
700	b2	Did you lose it on purpose?
701	a3	No, of course not!
701	b3	I lost it when I was sorting thru the mail.
702	a1	Do you remember that time we saved that bird in the park?
702	b1	I do. It was great.
703	a2	Sometimes I wonder if the bird remembers us.
703	b2	Remember us? I doubt it, but I guess you never know.
704	a3	Maybe we could find an ornithologist and ask him how well birds remember people.
704	b3	Seems like a lot of work though.
705	a1	Did you watch the game last night?
705	b1	no had to work late
706	a2	You really missed a great game.
706	b2	Don't spoil it! I have it on my DVR.
707	a3	So you really don't want to talk about the game?
707	b3	No. Not until I watch it first.
708	a1	Do you like turtles?
708	b1	No, because one bit me once.
709	a2	What did you do to make a turtle bite you?
709	b2	Well I was putting my finger in front of it's mouth to check it wouldn't bite me. But then it did, so now I hate turtles and am still oblivious to my own stupidity.
710	a3	Dude, you'd better stay away from all animals I think.
710	b3	I try but they keep following me home. I don't know what to do!
711	a1	Does anybody know where I left my hat?
711	b1	You left it on the table.
712	a2	Thanks. I've been looking for it all day.
712	b2	Want me to go get it and hand it to you right now?
713	a3	That would be great. Could you also place it on my head for me?
713	b3	I guess so, here you go.
714	a1	Can you help me get ready?
714	b1	Yes, you should wear this
715	a2	I would rather wear something black
715	b2	Fine, then find something yourself.
716	a3	Could you help me decide between these two black items?
716	b3	I like the one on the left more.
717	a1	What are your plans for the evening?
717	b1	I am going to catch up on my shows.
718	a2	Do that tomorrow.
718	b2	No, I have plans.
719	a3	What are you doing tomorrow?
719	b3	I have tickets to the ball game and Sam and I are meeting for early dinner then heading over.
720	a1	How was your weekend?
720	b1	It was great spending time with family.
721	a2	WHere were you?
721	b2	We all piled into the truck and headed down to the lake for a barbecue.
722	a3	Sounds like fun, I should do that with my family next time
722	b3	Yeah, it was a good time.
723	a1	What did she say?
723	b1	Not all that much, honestly. She seemed pretty upset.
724	a2	I bet, it's a pretty bad situation.
724	b2	I hope she can take some time off from work.
725	a3	They told her she can have all of the time she needs.
725	b3	That's good of them, she really needs it.
726	a1	Why he is not here?
726	b1	Because he wasn't feeling well.
727	a2	I am sorry to hear that.
727	b2	He will probably be well soon.
728	a3	What's wrong with him?
728	b3	He has strep throat and a double ear infection.
729	a1	How was your week?
729	b1	Long, I am glad it is Friday.
730	a2	Aren't we all glad it's Friday.
730	b2	Friday is our reward for surviving Monday through Thursday.
731	a3	I hear you. What are you doing tonight?
731	b3	Out to eat, want to join?
732	a1	Can you give me a recipe?
732	b1	Depends on what you want to cook.
733	a2	The special one you have for chicken and dumplings.
733	b2	Oh, I don't know. That's actually my mom's secret recipe.
734	a3	Please? It is my sweet-heart's favorite. I promise not to publish it on the 'net.
734	b3	That's what you said about my honeymoon photos.
735	a1	Do you think I have what it takes to be a model?
735	b1	No, because you're too short.
736	a2	There must a need to model for short people.
736	b2	I don't know. Do short people buy clothes?
737	a3	Yes short people buy clothes, but no one wants to see short people on the runway!
737	b3	That isn't true, celebrities make appearances on the runway all the time and they often much shorter than the average model.
738	a1	When will the game start?
738	b1	It starts in 30 minutes.
739	a2	Who are you rooting for?
739	b2	The home team.
740	a3	That is who I am rooting for also.
740	b3	Come over and watch it with me.
741	a1	Are we done yet?
741	b1	it depends on what you consider to be done
742	a2	Way to be snarky about it, jerk.
742	b2	Well it's a team project, so we both decide when it's done.
743	a3	Well, I think it's done. What do you think still needs to be done?
743	b3	i think we need one finishing touches.
744	a1	Sorry to hear that, can you tell me what happened?
744	b1	Not right now.
745	a2	Why not? I thought we were close.
745	b2	Not as close as you think.
746	a3	I'm sorry you feel that way.
746	b3	How else I'm I supposed to feel, we just met yesterday.
747	a1	Is there any ice cream in the freezer?
747	b1	No, but there are some ice lollies.
748	a2	OK, can you please grab me one?
748	b2	No, you get up and do it your self.
749	a3	Well that's the last time I grab you something from the store, mate.
749	b3	I won't pay the rent this month, bloke.
750	a1	Would you like a drink?
750	b1	Yes, a glass of water please.
751	a2	Would you like ice with your water?
751	b2	No, I can't stand water with ice in it.
752	a3	Why do you dislike ice in your water?
752	b3	It's too cold and it hurts my teeth.
753	a1	Would you like to have lunch with me?
753	b1	I'd be delighted to have lunch with you.
754	a2	Do you have any preferences?
754	b2	There's a new restaurant over in Oakdale that I've been wanting to try out.
755	a3	Fun! What kind of restaurant is it?
755	b3	It's Thai Food.
756	a1	Where are you going?
756	b1	To the zoo and a movie
757	a2	Awesome! Can we come too?
757	b2	Sure, if you hurry. We're leaving in 30 minutes.
758	a3	Cool, thanks. This should be fun!
758	b3	Don't you want to know which movie we are seeing?
759	a1	What breed of dog is that?
759	b1	She is a mix breed, schnauzer and poodle.
760	a2	Mixed breed dogs are the best kind.
760	b2	I just love all dogs.
761	a3	Oh, yeah that's cool.
761	b3	Where did you get her from?
762	a1	I need to use the restroom, can you tell me where it is?
762	b1	Go up those stairs, to the left.
763	a2	Thank you. Have a good day.
763	b2	You as well.
764	a3	Before I go do I need a key or anything?
764	b3	No, it's unlocked.
765	a1	Can we go to the store later tonight?
765	b1	Yes, around what time?
766	a2	Is 11 pm fine for you?
766	b2	Yes, that's perfect.
767	a3	Cool, I'll call you when I leave the house.
767	b3	my phone is broken remember?
768	a1	Can you fix this?
768	b1	yeah no problem I'll be there soon
769	a2	Great, I'll be waiting anxiously.
769	b2	And I will be moving hurriedly.
770	a3	What is your estimated time of arrival?
770	b3	I will be there in 15 minutes, estimatedly.
771	a1	Does it contain Soya?
771	b1	It isn't listed on the ingredients so I would have to say no.
772	a2	Thank you for checking.
772	b2	You're very welcome, I hope I'm right.
773	a3	What do you mean you hope?
773	b3	I heard that food companies sort of disguise ingredients in food?
774	a1	Why don't we go out for a meal later?
774	b1	Alright, where should we go?
775	a2	How about Panera?
775	b2	Sounds like a plan, man.
776	a3	Do you know if they have any new salads?
776	b3	Was there a spicy chicken salad on the menu? Something with a little kick.
777	a1	Have you ever visited Spain?
777	b1	No, but I'd love to see the bull run. How about you?
778	a2	The bull run sounds dangerous and inhumane.
778	b2	I guess, but there's lots more to see and do.
779	a3	We could go throw tomatoes at each other.
779	b3	That sounds gross and messy.
780	a1	Do you like dogs?
780	b1	I despise dogs, but I love peanut butter.
781	a2	Are you more of a cat person?
781	b2	I love cats, and also peanut butter. But not together.
782	a3	Why do you like peanut butter so much?
782	b3	Who doesn't love peanut butter?
783	a1	Where did you buy your house?
783	b1	I got it from an old lady who lived here before.
784	a2	How long have you lived in it?
784	b2	I have lived here for 10 years.
785	a3	I heard your house is haunted.
785	b3	That's not true at all.
786	a1	When will we meet again?
786	b1	Who knows? Next weekend maybe?
787	a2	Maybe? Why, what's going to happen to me? What do you know?
787	b2	Nothing. You're being paranoid.
788	a3	I am not being paranoid.
788	b3	Yes, you are one hundred percent being paranoid!
789	a1	Do you want to go to the pool?
789	b1	Okay, as long as those kids aren't still there. They're really kind of annoying.
790	a2	Oh, I don't want to go if there are annoying kids there, either.
790	b2	Do you know if there is an adults only pool here?
791	a3	No clue, but we should ask.
791	b3	Do you want me to call and ask?
792	a1	How long have you worked here?
792	b1	I started last January.
793	a2	Have you learned a lot?
793	b2	Yeah sure. In five months I've learned how to put condiments on buns. Huge accomplishment.
794	a3	if you hate it so much why have you been here five months?
794	b3	Ever heard of rent?
795	a1	What is his name?
795	b1	His name is Ken.
796	a2	Where did you meet him?
796	b2	We went to college together.
797	a3	And you just happened to run into him?
797	b3	We were standing in the same line at Starbucks.
798	a1	Can you tell me one more time?
798	b1	Sure, you have to double-click on the icon.
799	a2	Which icon do I click on?
799	b2	You click the small yellow icon on the bottom right of your screen.
800	a3	Thanks, now I see it.
800	b3	Is it working now for you?
801	a1	What breed is she?
801	b1	She Is a labrador retirever.
802	a2	Is she obedient?
802	b2	When she wants something, yes.
803	a3	What do you feed her?
803	b3	Oh the usual grain free diet
804	a1	Will my wheelchair fold properly?
804	b1	Yes, It should.
805	a2	If it doesn't I am sure we can tow it behind the car.
805	b2	Do you really think that towing it will be safe?
806	a3	I'm not sure if it's safe but it's the only way we're getting this thing home
806	b3	I don't think that's a good idea though.
807	a1	How are the kids?
807	b1	They are acting horrible.
808	a2	I'm sorry to hear that.
808	b2	Yeah, they need to be punished.
809	a3	That sounds a bit harsh. Try checking what they want first.
809	b3	Sure, because I haven't already fed them, taken them to the park, turned on their favorite movie and offered them crayons, playdoh and silly string.
810	a1	Where was the last place you looked for it?
810	b1	I looked in my room.
811	a2	If you kept it tidier, maybe you'd find it.
811	b2	Hahahah you're so funny.
812	a3	Since it's lost forever in your room of doom lets go get another one.
812	b3	But I've had this one for ages! It's my favourite.
813	a1	What was that noise?
813	b1	The landscaper just started the mower.
814	a2	How long will they be mowing?
814	b2	A couple of hours, I guess.
815	a3	Are they going to edge also?
815	b3	That's not in the agreement but if I ask him nicely I'm sure he will do it.
816	a1	Are you going home?
816	b1	Yes, I'm gonna make some dinner
817	a2	Let's go eat at a restaurant instead. My treat.
817	b2	Sure where would you like to go?
818	a3	I'd like some Thai food.Then how about some ice cream?
818	b3	Wow seems like a great idea.
819	a1	Do you have headphones I could use?
819	b1	Yes, I have a spare set.
820	a2	Nevermind I found mine.
820	b2	Where did you find them?
821	a3	They were underneath the couch.
821	b3	Hey, did you happen to feel a flip flop while you were down there? Mine left shoe has been missing for over a week.
822	a1	Can you open this please?
822	b1	No, I can't seem to get it, either.
823	a2	I think we need a new can opener.
823	b2	I will pick one up.
824	a3	All right then.
824	b3	Do you need money to buy a new one?
825	a1	How did you do?
825	b1	I believe I did pretty well.
826	a2	Shew! You probably did a lot better than myself.
826	b2	Oh come on, I'm sure you did great.
827	a3	Nope, I'm a loser, baby.
827	b3	Not in my eyes.
828	a1	Why did she leave early yesterday?
828	b1	The vet called about her dog.
829	a2	I hope everything is alright with her pet
829	b2	she just needs to pick it up.
830	a3	Oh, that's relieving.
830	b3	Trust me. If anything was wrong with her dog you would have known today.
831	a1	Do you like Dramas?
831	b1	Sure, as long as they're not too melodramatic.
832	a2	They are dramas, they are meant to be melodramatic, aren't they?
832	b2	I don't think they have to be melodramatic, do they?
833	a3	I guess you can be dramatic without going overboard.
833	b3	Speaking of overboard, have you tried that sailing trip yet?
834	a1	Can I have some orange juice, please?
834	b1	Certainly, let me get you a glass.
835	a2	Can I have some without pulp, please?
835	b2	I'm sorry, I only have extra pulp.
836	a3	Can we run it through the strainer?
836	b3	Sure! I'll be back in 2 minutes.
837	a1	When did the cat get out?
837	b1	Probably sometime in the afternoon.
838	a2	Did you find her yet?
838	b2	No, of course I haven't. That's why I'm putting up Cat Missing signs!
839	a3	Well, where did you look already?
839	b3	Around the block.
840	a1	Do you have any specials?
840	b1	Yes, they're listed on the wall.
841	a2	I was thinking more extraordinary specials.
841	b2	Would you like me to see what the chef could whip up?
842	a3	Maybe a Mediterranean seafood pasta?
842	b3	Are mussels, shrimp and calamari all right?
843	a1	WHat should we drink today?
843	b1	It's really hot outside. Let's get some lemonade.
844	a2	Where do you want to get it from?
844	b2	Let's get it from the house a street over, they have a stand out right now.
845	a3	Alright, I'll grab some change.
845	b3	I like to patronize local businesses.
846	a1	what time is the dinner?
846	b1	Dinner is at 6.
847	a2	What are we having?
847	b2	The menu is Italian today.
848	a3	What kind of sauce did you get?
848	b3	The kind with mushrooms and eggplant.
849	a1	Why don't we go out for a coffee?
849	b1	Sure. Let me go get my purse.
850	a2	Where do you want to go for coffee?
850	b2	well find something on the way.
851	a3	How about Big Foot Java? The people there are really nice.
851	b3	I don't really go to a coffee place for the people.
852	a1	Can you check it?
852	b1	yes, there is a coat check up front
853	a2	Is the coat check free?
853	b2	No, of course it's not. What kind of club do you think we are at?
854	a3	One where the coat check isn't free, evidently.
854	b3	This is a business I'm running, not a charity.
855	a1	Which is the closest date I can get for my next appointment?
855	b1	I'm sorry the soonest I can get you in would be 2 weeks from now. June 8th.
856	a2	Oh that's fine, I can wait 2 more weeks.
856	b2	So I'll put you down for June 8th.
857	a3	If that is the best appointment you can get me.
857	b3	Yes, that is the next available appointment. I have confirmed your appointment for June 8th at 1:50pm.
858	a1	Are you going to the school reunion?
858	b1	No, I'm busy that weekend.
859	a2	It's only every ten years!
859	b2	Yes it is and I have the right to choose whether to go or not.
860	a3	Well then I will go and have fun without you!
860	b3	I hope you enjoy yourself!
861	a1	Excuse me, do you remember me?
861	b1	I am so sorry I do not remember you.
862	a2	We Met at Jans party.
862	b2	There were so many people there though.
863	a3	I was the guy who put the lamp shade on his head.
863	b3	Oh, yes. The one everyone disliked.
864	a1	Did they get a divorce?
864	b1	I don't think so, I think they are just taking a break.
865	a2	I guess that's better than getting divorced. They should try and work it out.
865	b2	I agree. They should try to work it out.
866	a3	Well I hope they do work it out.
866	b3	Me too. It would be too bad if they have to get a divorce.
867	a1	Do you like going to art openings?
867	b1	Yes, I really enjoy seeing the new paintings.
868	a2	Did you know there's a new gallery downtown that's opening next week?

871	b2	Yep. That's the one.
872	a3	Do you want to come with me this afternoon?
872	b3	Yes. Is noon a good time for you?
873	a1	Where did the time go?
873	b1	I feel we wasted an entire day
874	a2	What did we actually do all day?
874	b2	Sat around and watched Netflix.
875	a3	Well, Netflix and chill isn't a complete waste of time. Still we should put in at least a couple hours into that paper.
875	b3	And waste a perfectly good evening? Let's go for a walk, grab dairy queen and then burn off the calories on the walk back.
876	a1	Where is the remote control?
876	b1	It's on the table.
877	a2	Can you get it for me please?
877	b2	Sure, no problem! Here it is.
878	a3	Thanks, I can't wait to watch the new episode
878	b3	Have you seen this show from the beginning of the season?
879	a1	Why are you acting like that?
879	b1	I don't know what you think is different.

884	b3	Yeah, I haven't tried them yet.
885	a1	When did you guys come?
885	b1	About 10 o'clock
886	a2	How did you come? Your car or public transport?
886	b2	We took the bus to get over here.
887	a3	I didn't know the bus ran that late on Mondays.
887	b3	If you didn't think the bus ran that late on Mondays then why did you bother asking if I took public transport?
888	a1	What is your name?
888	b1	My name is Alina.
889	a2	That's a beautiful name!
889	b2	I have a boyfriend.
890	a3	Does it mean are you engaged?

891	b1	I moved because of my job.
892	a2	What company do you work for?

896	b3	I would love to go to the park.
897	a1	Can I get change for a dollar?
897	b1	Yes, do you need quarters, nickles, dimes, or pennies?
898	a2	Four quarters please.
898	b2	Too bad I only have pennies.
899	a3	In that case, I'll just keep my dollar.
899	b3	Have a good day, sir.
900	a1	Will you help me look for my cell phone?
900	b1	No because it's in your hand
901	a2	That's not my phone, that's my mothers cell phone.
901	b2	I'm sorry, I didn't know you had the same one.
902	a3	Have you tried calling it yet?
902	b3	No, I'll try it now.
903	a1	Can I have something to eat please?
903	b1	No you may not.
904	a2	How come I cannot have something to eat?

911	b3	It seems like a good gig.
912	a1	Can you fix my collar, please?
912	b1	Of course, I'll help you with that.
913	a2	Thanks, I really can't get it myself.
913	b2	Why can't you reach It?
914	a3	Because I lost my arms in a car accident. Why are you yelling at me?
914	b3	Oh man I'm sorry about that.
915	a1	When did you do that?
915	b1	Late last night.
916	a2	You shouldn't have done it.
916	b2	I know but it was fun.
917	a3	Not for the sheep.
917	b3	How do you know that?
918	a1	Where are you going?

922	a2	Oh sad! Whose fault was it?
922	b2	I blame the coach.
923	a3	Did the coach get thrown out too?
923	b3	I don't think he was. I didn't get to see much because of all of the commotion going on and people moving out of the way.
924	a1	Who let the dog out?
924	b1	Your nephew, of course.
925	a2	Will you help me catch the dog before he eats the neighbor's trash again?
925	b2	I'll do my best.
926	a3	Good, that dog loves to eat trash and my neighbor gets really mad
926	b3	Maybe if you fed him well, he wouldn't be looking for food in other people's trash.
927	a1	Have you seen the new film?
927	b1	Yeah, I saw it on opening weekend. It was so-so.
928	a2	It had really good reviews though, I think I'll see it anyway.

929	a3	I guess I'll see it with Steven.
929	b3	You told me you weren't seeing Steven anymore!

937	b2	Who did it?

938	b3	Wow, she's done a pretty great job!
939	a1	What are your plans after graduation?
939	b1	I'm not sure what my plans are.

947	b3	Jokes aside, I can teach you sometime.
948	a1	Did you start the dishwasher?
948	b1	Yes, I started the dishwasher.
949	a2	Thanks, can you help me clean the living room?
949	b2	Sure I'll help you clean the living room. But after that I would like us to go for a nice walk.
950	a3	I am not feeling like going for a walk tonight, I am pretty tired.
950	b3	So how about we go for a walk before we clean the living room?
951	a1	How did my boss take the news?
951	b1	Not very well
952	a2	Yeah, he handles everything like that
952	b2	He said he was gonna fire you, dude.

959	b3	You have to rest your legs from all the walking yesterday.
960	a1	Did you watch the game last night?
960	b1	No I fell asleep early.
961	a2	You missed a good game. Those last five minutes were intense.
961	b2	Oh? What happened?
962	a3	Nothing. I don't want to ruin it for you.
962	b3	I appreciate that.
963	a1	Can we buy a pony?
963	b1	What do you think?
964	a2	I think you're the best parent ever!
964	b2	That is exactly the response I was looking for!

971	a3	Why do I get the feeling you're pulling my leg?
971	b3	I can't imagine.

986	b3	That's the spirit loyal subject.
987	a1	Do you like to make art?
987	b1	I do when I have time.
988	a2	Your art is good, you should try and set aside time for it.
988	b2	I should, but I've been really busy with work lately.
989	a3	Well, I really hope it lets up soon. I like your stuff a lot.
989	b3	Thanks Grandma, that is sweet of you. How's Grandpa doing?
990	a1	Can you repeat that slower?
990	b1	Ok, here we go.
991	a2	Thank you, it's hard for me to hear.
991	b2	No worries! I have that problem when my allergies bother me. Where should I start?
992	a3	At the beginning please?
992	b3	Alright, I'll talk slower this time.
993	a1	What do you think of it here?
993	b1	It's nice, a little too quiet though.
994	a2	We can turn up the music, if you'd like.
994	b2	It isn't really the lack of noise, it's the lack of activity.
995	a3	If you have a deck of cards we can play a game.
995	b3	Do you like to play poker?
996	a1	How is everything with you?
996	b1	Pretty good, you?
997	a2	Very good, life is great!
997	b2	Really? Are you sure? If something's wrong, you can totally tell me.
998	a3	Well, I'm having some problems at work.
998	b3	what kind of problems?
999	a1	What is that noise?
999	b1	That noise is the the firetruck leaving to go to a fire.
1000	a2	Can I come?
1000	b2	No sweetie, only the firefighters can go.
1001	a3	maybe I should become a firefighter
1001	b3	You would make a great firefighter!
1002	a1	Why don't my friends visit any more?
1002	b1	It might have something to do with your personal hygiene, kiddo.
1003	a2	I can't help it if my shower is broken.
1003	b2	Use the shower at the gym then. And deodarant.
1004	a3	I don't have a gym membership. How about you let me use yours?

1019	b3	Yeah, said no one ever!
1020	a1	What have you made for lunch today?
1020	b1	I didn't, I need to step out for lunch today.
1021	a2	Awesome! Can I go with you?
1021	b2	Sure if you want to go to the grocery store down the street that has the salad bar.
1022	a3	Ok, the grocery salad bar sounds like a good lunch.
1022	b3	I think they have a bakery too. We should see if they sell cookies individually.
1023	a1	Did you see the game last night?
1023	b1	I did see it, it was amazing!
1024	a2	LeBron looked sluggish though.
1024	b2	I agree. Must not have gotten enough sleep.
1025	a3	They all have to pull their weight. It didn't help that Kevin Love had to leave the game.
1025	b3	Hopefully he's not hurt too badly.
1026	a1	How late did you stay at the party?
1026	b1	Until just after midnight.
1027	a2	What time did you get home?
1027	b2	I got home just before 1am
1028	a3	Did you get lucky?
1028	b3	I sure did!
1029	a1	How come you didn't come to the party?
1029	b1	I got really sick.
1030	a2	I hope you feel better!
1030	b2	Thank you it is just alittle bug though.
1031	a3	Make sure you drink plenty of fluids.

1033	b2	No you won't need your passport until we come back.
1034	a3	Are they going to search our bags?
1034	b3	They might check our bags.
1035	a1	Do you think I should write back?
1035	b1	Yes, I don't think it will hurt to try.
1036	a2	What do you think I should write?
1036	b2	I'm not sure , say whats on your mind!
1037	a3	I'm just going to text him that I'm not interested and he needs to move on.
1037	b3	Be nice though!
1038	a1	Are there places to eat near?
1038	b1	Yes. McDonalds and Applebees
1039	a2	Let's go to Applebee's!
1039	b2	I've never eaten there, do they have pizza?
1040	a3	I don't think so, but they have good wings.
1040	b3	I don't like wings, they are messy.
1041	a1	Do you know which search engine I should use for recipes?
1041	b1	I usually use Google.
1042	a2	I don't like Google. Is there a better one?
1042	b2	Have you tried a specialized search engine? I like the one at allrecipes.
1043	a3	I have never used that but I will give it a shot.
1043	b3	If you do use that site search for the Tuna Souvlaki Pasta. Also they have a bunch of Ramadan recipes too!
1044	a1	What did you get mom?
1044	b1	A new bathrobe.
1045	a2	Did she say she wanted one? I bought her a gift certificate for the Spa because she was saying last week she wanted to go there.
1045	b2	That's nice too. But I'm quite sure mom will like my gift better. Because it's from her favourite child.
1046	a3	I'm sure you mean my gift, because I'm her favorite child.
1046	b3	She will like both of our gifts.
1047	a1	Hi, what's your name?
1047	b1	My name is John.
1048	a2	It's so nice to meet you, John!
1048	b2	Likewise. I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name.
1049	a3	My name is Frank.
1049	b3	How long have you been coming here, Frank?
1050	a1	How old were you when you first started learning English?
1050	b1	From the day I was born.
1051	a2	Then where is your accent from?
1051	b2	It's a French accent.
1052	a3	Did you live in France?
1052	b3	Yes I lived in Bordeaux for 13 years.
1053	a1	Where did you go to college?
1053	b1	I went to college in New York City.
1054	a2	What was your favorite part of living in the city?
1054	b2	Coffee on every corner.
1055	a3	Wow, that's really sad
1055	b3	No way! I had so many coffee dates you wouldn't believe it!
1056	a1	Where is the bathroom?
1056	b1	Look out for the sign, it's just up ahead.
1057	a2	Oh, I see it, thanks.
1057	b2	I'll meet you right here as soon as I get out of there.
1058	a3	OK, what are we getting from here?
1058	b3	I was hoping we could grab some lunch.
1059	a1	What's on sale at the bakery this week?
1059	b1	Sir, this is a hotel, and I've told you several times already today that such a sentence is not a code for any special services at the hotel. Please stop.
1060	a2	Listen; my friend told me this was a place to get hash brownies so cough up the goods!
1060	b2	Leave or I will call the police.
1061	a3	But I AM the police!
1061	b3	Good then you're already here!
1062	a1	Are you free tonight?
1062	b1	No, I have a date with my couch.
1063	a2	Mind if I come over?
1063	b2	Only if you bring pizza!
1064	a3	Okay, but what time do you have to get ready for your date?
1064	b3	I'm always ready to sit on my couch!
1065	a1	How did Sam get such good grades?
1065	b1	He studied constantly and worked with several tutors.
1066	a2	How much did the tutors cost?
1066	b2	I think like $50 a session.
1067	a3	Not a bad return on investment I'd say!
1067	b3	Yes, I am quite satisfied with his results.
1068	a1	Which shampoo do you use?
1068	b1	I use this stuff I found at the dollar store. It is only a dollar and has color protection for my hair!
1069	a2	Wow! I wouldn't think that coming from the Dollar Store!
1069	b2	I was surprised, too.
1070	a3	You are braver than I am. I would be afraid it would fry my hair.
1070	b3	Well, it did make some of my hair fall out, but the color protection is still great.
1071	a1	When is your next test?
1071	b1	Sometime in July.
1072	a2	Well, good luck.
1072	b2	Thanks! You're so kind.
1073	a3	Do you think you will pass?
1073	b3	I've been studying up a storm so I hope I pass.
1074	a1	Hello, how are you?
1074	b1	I'm good. How are you?
1075	a2	Awesome,thank you so much
1075	b2	Well, have a nice day.
1076	a3	You, too. Nice to see you.
1076	b3	Nice to see you too. Tell your sister I said hi.
1077	a1	When will the nurse come to see me?
1077	b1	She is on her way and will be here within the next 15 minutes.
1078	a2	Ok thank you.
1078	b2	No problem. Are you comfortable?
1079	a3	Yeah, I am pretty comfortable.
1079	b3	Do you need a refill on your water?
1080	a1	How did that happen?
1080	b1	I'm not sure.
1081	a2	What do you mean you're not sure?
1081	b2	I mean that I could give an answer, but I'd have a pretty good chance of being wrong.
1082	a3	You must have been super drunk.
1082	b3	We may have been drunk, and I may have forgotten, but I was able to convince you not to drive that night.
1083	a1	Could you repeat that please?
1083	b1	Sure, I said 'hello'
1084	a2	Oh, that's not at all what I thought you said.
1084	b2	What did you think I said?
1085	a3	For a second there, it sounded like Oh No.
1085	b3	Oh, nope, I was just saying hi!
1086	a1	Where do you think you are going?
1086	b1	I really want to go to the mall, can I?
1087	a2	I guess you can. Ask first next time.
1087	b2	Okay, I'm sorry.
1088	a3	While you're there can you buy me some socks?
1088	b3	What color would you like?
1089	a1	Do you know if it is raining yet?
1089	b1	I don't know, I haven't looked outside.
1090	a2	Does your phone not have the weather?
1090	b2	I never feel 100% sure unless I can see it for myself.
1091	a3	I know what you mean; weather apps are so often inaccurate!
1091	b3	We both have serious problems if we can't trust that it's raining until we actually feel it touching our bodies. Perhaps we should seek psychiatric assistance for our trust issues.
1092	a1	Did you take your pills?
1092	b1	No, I forgot to take my pills
1093	a2	Aren't they for forgetfullness?
1093	b2	Very funny. No, of course they don't make pills for that.
1094	a3	What a shame, you really could use some of those!
1094	b3	haha, I believe they should indeed.
1095	a1	When will you come back?
1095	b1	Right after I drop the kids off at hockey practice, why?
1096	a2	Great, can you please pick up some milk at the store on your way back?
1096	b2	Sure, do I need to pick up anything else while I'm there?
1097	a3	Get me a box of donuts; I need to put on some weight.
1097	b3	No donuts, Dear; We are starting our diet today.
1098	a1	Where is my good coat?
1098	b1	In the closet.
1099	a2	Has it been dry cleaned?
1099	b2	Yes, last week. The cleaner even sewed on the loose button.
1100	a3	Thank you so much honey! I love that coat and have missed not wearing it. I am taking you out for dinner tonight as a thank you.
1100	b3	Thank you Honey! that is so sweet of you!
1101	a1	Is your mom coming to visit tomorrow?
1101	b1	Yes, after lunch.
1102	a2	Do you mind if I stop by? I would love to see her.
1102	b2	Absolutely , she would love to see you also!
1103	a3	How is she doing?
1103	b3	She is doing well, she had surgery last week so she has been resting.
1104	a1	Where is the meeting room?
1104	b1	Down the hall to your left.
1105	a2	Has anyone else arrived?
1105	b2	Yes a few people are already in the room.
1106	a3	Good; I hate being the first to arrive.
1106	b3	Don't forget to greet everyone, those are very important clients.
1107	a1	What have you bought, today?
1107	b1	Groceries and dog food
1108	a2	Good. We need more dog food.
1108	b2	Did we need groceries too?
1109	a3	Yes! It's not just the dog who needs to eat!
1109	b3	Yes, we need to eat too!
1110	a1	How's your wife doing?
1110	b1	She's better now that she's had the procedure done.
1111	a2	I'm so glad to hear that. Give her my best, would you?
1111	b2	Of course, she'll be happy to hear I saw you today.
1112	a3	I know! I have been thinking a lot about you guys lately.
1112	b3	You're very thoughtful.
1113	a1	What are your summer vacation plans?
1113	b1	I don't have any plans yet.
1114	a2	You should come to the beach with us!
1114	b2	I am not sure. I think I may just get a part time job this summer. Tired of eating ramen noodles.
1115	a3	You could work for a couple of months and then take a week off.
1115	b3	You should learn to love more and judge a little less.
1116	a1	Why haven't you done anything?
1116	b1	I'm not feeling well.
1117	a2	Why, what's wrong with you?
1117	b2	I have a really bad headache.
1118	a3	Maybe you should step away from your computer and phone for a bit.
1118	b3	You literally pay me to be at my computer and phone all day. Are you offering me a paid vacation?
1119	a1	Are you getting married?
1119	b1	Not any time soon!
1120	a2	Of course you are!
1120	b2	No, I'm not.
1121	a3	Good, then you can take off with me to Bermuda.
1121	b3	Don't I wish?
1122	a1	Where did you buy your wallet?
1122	b1	I found it in the street.
1123	a2	Did you try to return it?
1123	b2	It did not have anything in it so I don't know where I would return it.
1124	a3	It was probably stolen and tossed after the money and credit cards were removed.
1124	b3	I think I will turn it in to the police.
1125	a1	Can you pass me that object?
1125	b1	I will give it to you.
1126	a2	thank you very much
1126	b2	You're quite welcome
1127	a3	Can you pass me the thing next to it too? I can't remember what you call these things!
1127	b3	Sure not a problem, would you also like the others next to it?
1128	a1	Are you feeling ok?
1128	b1	I feel fine.
1129	a2	I am asking because you look really pale and tired.
1129	b2	I had trouble sleeping last night but the coffee is starting to kick in.
1130	a3	That reminds me, I need a cup myself.
1130	b3	How could you ever forget your coffee?
1131	a1	Will you call my husband?
1131	b1	If you need me to. What should I tell him?
1132	a2	Tell him I will be late
1132	b2	Fine, though you could really do that yourself.
1133	a3	I'm making the pie filling and I don't want to get jam all over the phone.
1133	b3	Oh, no problem. I'll call him.
1134	a1	Did the car get dented up?
1134	b1	No, it didn't.
1135	a2	Is the other car okay?
1135	b2	No, more like a total loss.
1136	a3	Did anyone get hurt?
1136	b3	No, the other driver was totally drunk but somehow came out without a scratch.
1137	a1	Is there anything on TV tonight?
1137	b1	I don't know. Look it up on your phone.
1138	a2	Alright, just give me one second.
1138	b2	One. Time's up!
1139	a3	You knew what I meant smartie pants!
1139	b3	I know, I know you hate how literal I am.
1140	a1	Can you even cook?
1140	b1	yes, I can cook very delicious meals.
1141	a2	Maybe one day I can taste your cooking.
1141	b2	This weekend? We could get a dinner party going.
1142	a3	Sounds good. Who shall we invite?
1142	b3	How about Jack and Diane?
1143	a1	Is it a bad thing that I don't receive my medication in time?
1143	b1	Yes. Medication should be taken in a timely manner.
1144	a2	Who can I complain to?
1144	b2	You should call the head nurse.
1145	a3	What is the head nurse's name?
1145	b3	I don't know but I bet if you press that red button someone will show up
1146	a1	Can you pick me up?
1146	b1	Yes, whenever you are ready.
1147	a2	I'm ready right now, come right now!
1147	b2	Ok I'm on my way
1148	a3	Call me when you get here.
1148	b3	Okay, sure thing.
1149	a1	Is it raining outside?
1149	b1	No, but it might rain later today.
1150	a2	Will it get colder, too?
1150	b2	I'm not positive, but a taking a sweater with you might be smart.
1151	a3	I will. Thanks for the warning!
1151	b3	You're welcome, have a good time.
1152	a1	What room is he in?
1152	b1	He's down the hall in room 112.
1153	a2	How long has he been there?
1153	b2	For about 2 weeks.
1154	a3	What has he been doing all this time?
1154	b3	I am not at liberty to say what has been going on in his room, but you are more than welcome to go see him.
1155	a1	What do you think it means?
1155	b1	He is just not that into you!
1156	a2	Well that's a little harsh, you don't know that!
1156	b2	No but I'll bet my next paycheck on it.
1157	a3	Well I will take that bet.
1157	b3	Be prepared to lose.
1158	a1	Do you know the time of her flight?
1158	b1	I have to look it up
1159	a2	I was hoping to say goodbye before she left.
1159	b2	She'll be back on Monday. It's only a short business trip this time.
1160	a3	I don't know what I'll do with myself until she gets back.
1160	b3	We could hang out together on Saturday.
1161	a1	Where are your dressing rooms?
1161	b1	at the back on the left
1162	a2	Can I bring all of these clothes in with me?
1162	b2	Only if you promise not to steal anything.
1163	a3	What is that supposed to mean? You know what; never mind!
1163	b3	Sorry, just trying to be funny.
1164	a1	What is the weather like?
1164	b1	It's sunny outside.
1165	a2	I think I will do some gardening today.
1165	b2	That sounds like fun!
1166	a3	I love watching my flowers bloom.
1166	b3	Mind If I help? I love blooming flowers more than life itself.
1167	a1	Can you open the door for me?
1167	b1	Yes, sure I can.
1168	a2	Thank you very much, son.
1168	b2	You are very welcome father.
1169	a3	Now go and clean that trash heap you call your room.
1169	b3	But I don't even live here anymore
1170	a1	Who is this and where do you want me to pick you up?
1170	b1	It's Bill, and I need you to pick me up at the store.
1171	a2	I will be right there, don't go anywhere.
1171	b2	Ok I'm out front by the kids electric train.
1172	a3	Ok. I will be there in about 10 minutes.
1172	b3	Please hurry, this train is driving me nuts.
1173	a1	Can you turn up the volume on the television?
1173	b1	Sure, as soon as I find the remote.
1174	a2	Can't we just go up to the television to turn it up?
1174	b2	yeah if I wanted to
1175	a3	You may be the laziest person I know.
1175	b3	Then again, it may be someone else.
1176	a1	Could you come over?
1176	b1	I can come later today.
1177	a2	Ok, I'll be waiting.
1177	b2	Want me to pick up anything?
1178	a3	Yes, a box of KFC would be great.
1178	b3	okay will bring.
1179	a1	Did you remember to take your library books back on Tuesday?
1179	b1	Yes, stop nagging me!
1180	a2	Don't talk to me like that , I was trying to help
1180	b2	It's not helping if I don't want you to do it.
1181	a3	Well I'm your mother so I will nag you if I think you need it.
1181	b3	The only thing that keeps me from running away, is dinner!
1182	a1	Did you get a gift?
1182	b1	yes a starbucks card
1183	a2	Do you like Starbucks?
1183	b2	Yes but they're expensive.
1184	a3	But their coffee is sure good.
1184	b3	There really is no comparison.
1185	a1	Has the doctor arrived?
1185	b1	No, not yet.
1186	a2	But we have waited as the first in line for two hours!
1186	b2	I'm sorry, he's really busy.
1187	a3	This is a medical urgency!
1187	b3	I will go find out what's the hold up. give me a moment please.
1188	a1	How was your weekend?
1188	b1	Just fantastic. How was yours?
1189	a2	It was fun. I went to the amusement park.
1189	b2	What rides did you ride while at the park?
1190	a3	I went on a few roller coasters.
1190	b3	Do they have the nasty one with all the loops?
1191	a1	What movies are in your top 5 of all time?
1191	b1	Police Academy, Police Academy II, Police Academy:Mission To Moscow, Baby Geniuses and Metropolis.
1192	a2	I see you like the deep intellectual stuff. Nice
1192	b2	Yeah, that's why we aren't friends.
1193	a3	Then why are you standing here talking to me?
1193	b3	I'm conducting interviews with people who enjoy trivial movies.
1194	a1	Are you kidding me?
1194	b1	Yes, I was.
1195	a2	Well that was inappropriate.
1195	b2	I'm sorry, I won't do that again.
1196	a3	Thank you. Let's talk about something else now.
1196	b3	What do you want to talk about?
1197	a1	When will it be fixed?
1197	b1	I would estimate it should be fixed by tomorrow.
1198	a2	What time tomorrow?
1198	b2	Probably seven o'clock. I'm not sure, of course, as I can't see into the future.
1199	a3	Well if it's done by seven we can get dinner afterwards.
1199	b3	I'd like that. Where would you like to go?
1200	a1	Did she agree to go with you to the party?
1200	b1	No she did not.
1201	a2	Well, just mark her off the list for future adventures.
1201	b2	Doesn't that sound kind of harsh?
1202	a3	Yeah maybe a little, but it is better to be safe than sorry where the heart is concerned.
1202	b3	I don't know dude, you've got to give people second chances.
1203	a1	How was the gym?
1203	b1	My workout today was really hard.
1204	a2	Well it will get easier the more you work out
1204	b2	I think it's easier to just quit.
1205	a3	It is but not as rewarding.
1205	b3	True, maybe I'll keep on for a while yet.
1206	a1	When will you call me?
1206	b1	I'll give you a call Friday when I'm off work, sometime after 5pm, and we can make arrangements.
1207	a2	Change that to 6pm, 5 is dinner time.
1207	b2	How about you call me when you are done with dinner?
1208	a3	That sounds like a plan.
1208	b3	I'll check movie times at the new cineplex. Any preference?
1209	a1	How are you doing?
1209	b1	I am doing well. How are you doing?
1210	a2	Doing as well as can be expected, I guess.
1210	b2	Are you sure everything is okay?
1211	a3	No, do you want the long or short version?
1211	b3	I've got time. Whatever version you want to tell is fine.
1212	a1	Where are my keys?
1212	b1	They are on the side table.
1213	a2	Who put them there?
1213	b2	You did, when your phone rang.
1214	a3	Right, I can be forgetful sometimes.
1214	b3	I find it helps if I put mine by the door all the time.
1215	a1	What's your favorite hobby?
1215	b1	I enjoy treasure hunting.
1216	a2	Where do you go treasure hunting?
1216	b2	The tropics are the best!
1217	a3	Oh, that sounds nice. Do you need a traveling companion?
1217	b3	I usually travel with my dog.
1218	a1	Did you enjoy your meal?
1218	b1	Yes, it was quite good
1219	a2	Would you like dessert?
1219	b2	If I eat dessert, my stomach will explode.
1220	a3	Okay, no dessert for you then.
1220	b3	I could go for a coffee though.
1221	a1	Would you like to order a pizza for us?
1221	b1	Okay, tell me what you want on it.
1222	a2	Just cheese, please, extra if you don't mind.
1222	b2	Oh, add mushrooms too.
1223	a3	What about sausage and salami?
1223	b3	screw it we will get everything
1224	a1	Sure, when do you want me to pick you up?
1224	b1	An hour maybe
1225	a2	Okay, I'll see you around 6:00 then!
1225	b2	Great, I can't wait to see you!
1226	a3	Be ready, you usually take forever!
1226	b3	I'll set my clocks ahead a few minutes so I'm ready on time.
1227	a1	Why did she go with Patrick?
1227	b1	Because she is in love with Patrick
1228	a2	What does she like so much about Patrick?
1228	b2	She likes everything about Patrick.
1229	a3	What do you think of Patrick?
1229	b3	I think he is a spoiled brat to be honest.
1230	a1	Do you enjoy cold weather?
1230	b1	Yes it was a nice break from the heat.
1231	a2	Where are you from?
1231	b2	Arizona. The heat can be unbearable there sometimes.
1232	a3	So I have heard. Have you ever thought of moving someplace a little cooler?
1232	b3	From time to time, but I get over it.
1233	a1	Can I watch TV?
1233	b1	After you finish your homework.
1234	a2	I already finished.
1234	b2	Then go ahead, son!
1235	a3	Thanks! My favorite cartoon is on.
1235	b3	You are welcome!
1236	a1	Did the professor say we had to do any extra problems?
1236	b1	No, but there is extra credit if you are interested.
1237	a2	Do you think we should do the extra credits?
1237	b2	Yes, they are hard but it means we won't have to take that statistics course.
1238	a3	Sounds good, you do the work and give me the answers.
1238	b3	How about no! Let's share the work, it'll be quicker that way.
1239	a1	Should I pick you up?
1239	b1	No I'll walk
1240	a2	Thank you though. I might need a ride back home if that is ok.
1240	b2	Sure I'll be leaving at 11pm.
1241	a3	Okay I will text you if I need a ride home.
1241	b3	Uh oh, let me make sure I have my cell. I always forget it.
1242	a1	Where is the car?
1242	b1	In the parking lot.
1243	a2	Is the tank full or I will have to go to the gas station?
1243	b2	You'll have to stop at the gas station
1244	a3	where is the nearest gas station then?
1244	b3	Just a mile after you exit the parking lot.
1245	a1	Where can I catch the bus?
1245	b1	The bus stop is at the end of the road.
1246	a2	Thank you for your directions. It looks like it may rain.
1246	b2	You're welcome. I think the bus stop is covered.
1247	a3	I sure hope so.
1247	b3	Well here, take my umbrella just in case.
1248	a1	Will Eva help me with my studies?
1248	b1	Yes, she is an excellent tutor.
1249	a2	Thank god! I was looking for someone who could teach me, my exams are near.
1249	b2	Yeah, you'll like her. She's very smart.
1250	a3	I hope not too smart, where she can't get on my level on understanding.
1250	b3	Oh no, she is the best. help me pass my finals.
1251	a1	What time do you want to leave?
1251	b1	I would like to leave at noon.
1252	a2	OK, make sure you have your things ready.
1252	b2	Will we need to bring snacks or are we stopping for lunch?
1253	a3	We will stop for lunch but snacks are good too.
1253	b3	Do you have a snack preference? I'd like to get something we all like.
1254	a1	Do you carry plastic garbage bags at this store?
1254	b1	No, but we do sell reusable bags if you'd like to purchase one.
1255	a2	Are they reusable shopping bags or reusable garbage bags?
1255	b2	Reusable shopping bags that can be used for garbage bags
1256	a3	Who the heck would do that with those bags? No thanks
1256	b3	I guess you'll just carry around all your garbage then.
1257	a1	What did you have for breakfast today?
1257	b1	I ate cold pizza.
1258	a2	I think cold pizza is disgusting.
1258	b2	I think your face is disgusting, but I was able to use good manners and keep that opinion to myself all this time.
1259	a3	Wow, that escalated quickly. Geez.
1259	b3	As usual between us!
1260	a1	Can I have a cookie?
1260	b1	No, honey, you have to have dinner first.
1261	a2	when are we having dinner?
1261	b2	Dinner will be ready in about 30 minutes. It won't be long.
1262	a3	Are you sure I can't have a little nibble, pretty please?
1262	b3	You can have a baby carrot to tide you over.
1263	a1	Can you give me your contact number?
1263	b1	Yes. Put it in your phone so you don't lose it.
1264	a2	Actually, can you send me a text instead?
1264	b2	I will text you in a second.
1265	a3	Take your time!
1265	b3	Okay, I'll do it in a few minutes.
1266	a1	Can I make it up to you?
1266	b1	Well, you can certainly try. This better not happen again, though. I'm serious.
1267	a2	I'm so sorry! What do you need me to do?
1267	b2	I need to feel like I can trust you.
1268	a3	What can I do to make you trust me again?
1268	b3	I don't know, but it's going to take time. Trust doesn't just magically appear when you want it to.
1269	a1	Is it still raining?
1269	b1	Yes, it's a monsoon!
1270	a2	I can not make it tonight
1270	b2	Ok. Hopefully ma see ya soon!
1271	a3	Yes, a little rain storm won't stop me
1271	b3	But a monsoon will?
1272	a1	Can you turn on the television?
1272	b1	No, you can get up and turn it on yourself.
1273	a2	You never do anything for me.
1273	b2	I do things for you all the time!
1274	a3	Give me an example.
1274	b3	Who pays for the lights to stay on? Who's car do you take to work everyday? Those are two examples for you.
1275	a1	Could you please help me pick out a cell phone provider?
1275	b1	I think sprint is best
1276	a2	Sprint took me to court over a unpaid $16 bill.
1276	b2	That's ridiculous. What about Verizon?
1277	a3	Sure, what are their rates?
1277	b3	I have no idea, I'm with Sprint.
1278	a1	Who did you vote for?
1278	b1	I forgot to vote.
1279	a2	How on Earth could you forget to vote?
1279	b2	Because I have a lot on my mind.
1280	a3	You only vote once! What could be more important?
1280	b3	Anything is more important than voting.
1281	a1	Who is at the door?
1281	b1	It is the guy who lives next door.
1282	a2	What does that weirdo want?
1282	b2	Probably to complain about the noise again
1283	a3	You realize he can hear you through the door, right?
1283	b3	Pretty sure he heard you call him a weirdo too.
1284	a1	I don't know where he went, have you tried calling him?
1284	b1	I did but it went straight to voicemail.
1285	a2	Did you leave a message?
1285	b2	I did, but who knows if he will check it.
1286	a3	I know his usual hangouts, I'm going to get in the car and go find his butt. He knows I will drag his butt out of a party if he is at a party.
1286	b3	You are certainly a very dedicated teacher, Mary Kay.
1287	a1	What time is it?
1287	b1	It is a quarter after 10.
1288	a2	Oh! I really need to get home, then!
1288	b2	Have a safe drive!
1289	a3	I will thanks.
1289	b3	its ok dude
1290	a1	Will I be able to sit for the exams?
1290	b1	Yes, we have desks for you to sit In.
1291	a2	Great, I'd look silly sitting on the floor.
1291	b2	Why did you think you would have to sit on the floor?
1292	a3	Well it is a yoga exam. I'm surprised they are supplying desks.
1292	b3	Well I am suprised I am still shouting over this, but here I am, shouty mcshoutface again!
1293	a1	How was the show?
1293	b1	Terrible. The worst show I've ever been to.
1294	a2	Oh my gosh, what are you going to tell her?
1294	b2	I'm not going to tell her, I will lie.
1295	a3	Are you sure that's a good idea?
1295	b3	No. I guess you are right. I should just be honest.
1296	a1	Have you ever tried chocolate covered ants?
1296	b1	I would never eat that.
1297	a2	Have you tried them?
1297	b2	What part of never do you not get?
1298	a3	Well, yeah, I guess that makes sense.
1298	b3	What makes you ask that anyway? Do you have some?
1299	a1	Could you recommend a good book to me?
1299	b1	Yes, you should read Infinite Jest.
1300	a2	I said a GOOD book.
1300	b2	It's a pretty funny book.
1301	a3	We must have totally different taste in reading material.
1301	b3	To each his own.
1302	a1	How is your leg now?
1302	b1	It's getting better.
1303	a2	Have the doctors told you how much longer before it heals?
1303	b2	No, I haven't wanted to hear that yet.
1304	a3	Why? it's no harm in knowing the truth.
1304	b3	I just feel like knowing when it should heal will have me constantly waiting on that day. I would rather not know.
1305	a1	Can I please have a glass of water?
1305	b1	If you would like one yes
1306	a2	I'm so thirsty I could drink a whole ocean.
1306	b2	You shouldn't. It's saltwater.
1307	a3	Well, how about the great lakes?
1307	b3	yes you can
1308	a1	So what do you have planned for dinner?
1308	b1	I'm sort of hoping to go out.
1309	a2	Where are you planning on going?
1309	b2	To a Mexican restaurant.
1310	a3	Mexican food is my favorite, can I come along?
1310	b3	I guess. I don't think anyone would mind.
1311	a1	Do you prefer cars or bikes?
1311	b1	I prefer cars so that I can bring people along with me.
1312	a2	I feel the same way.
1312	b2	Do you want to go on a road trip next weekend?
1313	a3	Sure, shall we hit up Vegas again?
1313	b3	No, I'd rather head into Santa Monica.
1314	a1	What happened at the party?
1314	b1	People danced and had a good time.
1315	a2	What time did the party end?
1315	b2	About midnight or so.
1316	a3	I assumed it would go later, that's why I didn't go.
1316	b3	No, it wasn't a late night party at all.
1317	a1	Can you help me with my shoes?
1317	b1	No I can't help because I don't know how to tie shoes.
1318	a2	Fine, I'll ask mom.
1318	b2	You go ahead and do that, then.
1319	a3	OK, be right back.
1319	b3	Just so you know Mom doesn't know how to tie shoes either.
1320	a1	How are you doing today?
1320	b1	Pretty good so far.
1321	a2	That's good. It's always nice to have a good start to a day.
1321	b2	What did you do?
1322	a3	So far have just gotten coffee.
1322	b3	Any big plans for the rest of the day?
1323	a1	Wow, nice shoes! Where did you get those?
1323	b1	Thanks! I got them online at Amazon.com.
1324	a2	Were they expensive?
1324	b2	Well, kind of. But they were exactly what I've been looking for, so it's worth it.
1325	a3	Maybe I will get some new shoes too, I need some.
1325	b3	If you need shoes, be sure to check Amazon.
1326	a1	What happened to make you feel that way?
1326	b1	She broke up with me.
1327	a2	I'm sorry to hear that.
1327	b2	What should I have done differently?
1328	a3	I'm sorry, man. I just don't know.
1328	b3	Why did she have to leave me? I could have changed.
1329	a1	What will you do tommorow?
1329	b1	I have class at 9 and then am free for the rest of the day.
1330	a2	Can you come to the mall with me?
1330	b2	Sure. I need to buy some new socks.
1331	a3	Great. We can grab some lunch while we are there.
1331	b3	Sounds good. Want to head to Chipotle for lunch?
1332	a1	Did you get the payment?
1332	b1	No not yet.
1333	a2	Hmm, I may need to speak with your supervisor then.
1333	b2	Please speak to him soon.
1334	a3	I will let you know what I find out.
1334	b3	I really appreciate that.
1335	a1	Do you have any Aleeve?
1335	b1	Let me check.
1336	a2	Thanks, I have a terrible headache.
1336	b2	I sympathize since I suffer with migraines.
1337	a3	That sounds horrible, how often do you get them?
1337	b3	Every few weeks. I have medicine, but it's at home.
1338	a1	Can I have a cup of coffee?
1338	b1	how do you take it
1339	a2	Light and sweet please
1339	b2	I only have skim light and chemical sweet. Is that okay?
1340	a3	That will work if that's all you have.
1340	b3	okay coming right up.
1341	a1	Where are my red socks, do you know?
1341	b1	In the dryer.
1342	a2	You didn't put it on a high heat, did you?
1342	b2	I did, sorry.
1343	a3	It's ok. I'll probably have to get some more, though.
1343	b3	yes you will
1344	a1	What date is today?
1344	b1	It's may 25th.
1345	a2	What day of the week is it?
1345	b2	Today is Wednesday.
1346	a3	Jeez, I'm really kind of lost nowadays.
1346	b3	Really? What's been going on?
1347	a1	Where should we go tonight?
1347	b1	Dinner and a movie sounds good.
1348	a2	Sure, but please not the Olive Garden again for dinner.
1348	b2	How about Hamburgers somewhere?
1349	a3	I don' know about hamburgers, how about pizza?
1349	b3	Pizza sounds good, but I want to have a burger next time we go out.
1350	a1	Did you let the dog out?
1350	b1	Yes but he is back in now.
1351	a2	Could you make sure he's dry?
1351	b2	Okay, let me check.
1352	a3	Make sure he doesn't have dirt on his paws either.
1352	b3	He is dry and has no dirt on his paws.
1353	a1	This room stinks, can you open the windows?
1353	b1	Yes, I'll do that now.
1354	a2	Thanks. It already smells better in here.
1354	b2	Would you like me to light the candle, too?
1355	a3	If you wouldn't mind.
1355	b3	What smell would you prefer?
1356	a1	Is the Air conditioner on?
1356	b1	Yes. Is it still warm in here?
1357	a2	Yes, I'm still sweating due to the heat. I think the air conditioner is not working well.
1357	b2	So call someone to fix it.
1358	a3	Why do I always have to call? You know how to use a phone, too.
1358	b3	You don't always have to call. But I'm working now and you have some free time. So call, please.
1359	a1	Can you put the baseball game on the TV?
1359	b1	No, I do not like baseball, but you can turn it on in the family room.
1360	a2	You can come and watch it with me and see if you change your mind?
1360	b2	No, thanks maybe another time.
1361	a3	What is it you don't like about it?
1361	b3	It's boring. It's quiet, there is no real point to it. I just don't get the fascination with baseball.
1362	a1	How are you doing?
1362	b1	Very well, thank you.
1363	a2	Do you have any big plans for the weekend?
1363	b2	My plans for the weekend are so big, that they will cover next weekend as well.
1364	a3	Oh, it's one of those weekends.
1364	b3	Yes it is indeed!
1365	a1	How is your mom?
1365	b1	She's doing great.
1366	a2	Good to hear.
1366	b2	How are your parents doing?
1367	a3	Good. Just on their way to Florida for the winter.
1367	b3	I would love to spend the winters in Florida. Who am I kidding, I would love to spend all seasons in Florida.
1368	a1	Will you sign this?
1368	b1	Yes I will.
1369	a2	Don't forget to read it first, you could be giving me access to your cash.
1369	b2	I'll be sure to read the fine print. Thanks!
1370	a3	I've been surprised by how many people don't read the fine print.
1370	b3	I will not be one of those people
1371	a1	How are your allergies doing now that spring is here?
1371	b1	I don't have spring allergies.
1372	a2	I must be thinking of someone else.
1372	b2	You got that right.
1373	a3	You are the person who gets migraines then?
1373	b3	Yes, you're giving me one right now.
1374	a1	How are you doing?
1374	b1	I'm doing okay
1375	a2	You sound down. Are you sure?
1375	b2	Yeah, I've just been having a lot of stress at work.
1376	a3	I thought things at work were improving?
1376	b3	They are but we still have more work than time.
1377	a1	Could you help me with this?
1377	b1	Sure, how far did you get with it?
1378	a2	About half-way, I think.
1378	b2	Alright, what's next?
1379	a3	I'm not sure; I ate the instructions this morning for breakfast.
1379	b3	We can search online for a copy.
1380	a1	How much is it?
1380	b1	Well, because we're friends, I'll only charge you $50.
1381	a2	That's still not good enough.
1381	b2	What would you think is more reasonable?
1382	a3	I think $40 should be more than enough for that.
1382	b3	I spent $60 for it new and never used it so I need to charge $50
1383	a1	Do you have thread?
1383	b1	Yes, I have sewing thread. What color do you need?
1384	a2	Do you have any purple?
1384	b2	I might have purple. Let me look.
1385	a3	If you don't have purple I think black would work as well.
1385	b3	I have purple and black as well
1386	a1	How is your day?
1386	b1	Just fantastic. How's yours
1387	a2	It's going well, actually. My brother was just released from jail today.
1387	b2	Oh great! I want to see him!
1388	a3	Ok, but you have to go to his house, he's has an ankle monitor so is not allowed over 200 feet from his house.
1388	b3	That's probably a good thing.
1389	a1	How are your children?
1389	b1	They are well, thank you.
1390	a2	How are they in school?
1390	b2	They are doing rather well.
1391	a3	How is your husband?
1391	b3	He's doing well, too! Things are going pretty great for us. How about you?
1392	a1	Can you lend me some cash?
1392	b1	How much do you need?
1393	a2	Well roughly a million dollars, if I'm honest.
1393	b2	Too bad that won't happen in this lifetime.
1394	a3	Okay, then how about 10 bucks?
1394	b3	10 bucks I can do. What's it for?
1395	a1	Excuse me, do you know where I can find this item?
1395	b1	It is on the next aisle.
1396	a2	The next aisle to the right, or to the left?
1396	b2	The aisle to the right.
1397	a3	Okay, thank you for the help
1397	b3	You're very welcome!
1398	a1	What music do you like?
1398	b1	I like old school rock.
1399	a2	You are so predictable.
1399	b2	Yeah, my musical tastes are predictably awesome.
1400	a3	What else can you call perfection?
1400	b3	its just what I like.
1401	a1	What are we eating for super?
1401	b1	Let's go out and have a pizza
1402	a2	That sounds awesome! Let me go get my jacket and then we can leave!
1402	b2	Alright hold on, I have to find my shoes first.
1403	a3	Really? You have like three pairs. How come you're always looking for them?
1403	b3	I always find them right where I left them, I just can't remember where I left them.
1404	a1	Who ate the left overs?
1404	b1	I gave them to the dog.
1405	a2	I was going to eat those!
1405	b2	I'm sorry! I can make more.
1406	a3	No, it's too late! Now I have to eat the dogs food.
1406	b3	Hahaha! You're so funny!
1407	a1	Is it sunny outside?
1407	b1	Actually, it is partly cloudy.
1408	a2	Is it supposed to thunder later?
1408	b2	Yes. Thunderstorms popping up in the late afternoon, just in time for our drive home.
1409	a3	Great, that should make for some fun traffic.
1409	b3	I hate traffic
1410	a1	By the way, when can I see you again?
1410	b1	Tomorrow night would be wonderful.
1411	a2	I cannot wait until tomorrow.
1411	b2	You're going to have to.
1412	a3	Couldn't we get together tonight?
1412	b3	I have date with someone else tonight, no hard feelings.
1413	a1	Did you do the dishes already?
1413	b1	Yes, they are already clean.
1414	a2	Thanks for saving me some time.
1414	b2	I know you have had a hard day at work today, it's my pleasure.
1415	a3	I'll have to return the favor.
1415	b3	Thanks, but there's no need.
1416	a1	Can I get you a drink?
1416	b1	Yes please, I'd love an iced tea.
1417	a2	Do you want sugar in it or not?
1417	b2	No sugar please.
1418	a3	How about lemon?
1418	b3	If I wanted sugar and lemons in my drink I would have ordered a lemonade. Just get me the dang iced tea.
1419	a1	Can you repeat what you just said?
1419	b1	Yeah. What time is it?
1420	a2	It is binge watching time.
1420	b2	Excellent. What are we watching?
1421	a3	We are watching all 24 seasons of Simpsons!
1421	b3	I love Simpsons.
1422	a1	How was New York?
1422	b1	New York was wonderful. I really loved the Statue of Liberty.
1423	a2	How can anyone love a statue?
1423	b2	I love how she looks out to the sea.
1424	a3	That sounds ridiculous! There has to be a better reason
1424	b3	Why should there be a better reason? It's my reason and that's that!
1425	a1	What are some of the tourist attractions around here?
1425	b1	There is a great beach down the road. And a National Park. The history of diving museum is fun but that's a few miles away.
1426	a2	Oh! I didn't expect to find so much to do around here! How can I get to the diving museum?
1426	b2	I'm not sure, check a map.
1427	a3	I will take out my handy dandy iPhone and do just that. Thank You!
1427	b3	I hope you have fun.
1428	a1	Did you change your mind?
1428	b1	Nope I still have to go to the meeting instead.
1429	a2	Dang, do you think you're prepared for that meeting?
1429	b2	Wow, thanks for the vote of confidence dude.
1430	a3	I'm sorry, I didn't mean it that way. I'm sure you'll do fine.
1430	b3	Just fine? I need to knock this out of the park.
1431	a1	Can we go sit in the sun?
1431	b1	That sounds like a great idea.
1432	a2	That was sarcasm, why on earth would I want to sit in the sun?
1432	b2	To get a tan?
1433	a3	Yeah, but it's way too hot today.
1433	b3	But isn't that great tanning weather?
1434	a1	Where are my keys?
1434	b1	They are on the table.
1435	a2	Oh wow I can't believe I didn't see them, thanks!
1435	b2	You're welcome, but have you seen my phone?
1436	a3	I think I saw it in the bedroom on the nightstand.
1436	b3	Good thing we have each other around to keep track of things!
1437	a1	Why is no one answering their phones?
1437	b1	They are all at the movies.
1438	a2	Ah, I see. What did they go to?
1438	b2	The new batman movie
1439	a3	I wanted to see that one.
1439	b3	Well we could go see it together now if you want?
1440	a1	Have you been here before?
1440	b1	Yeah, I come here all the time.
1441	a2	What do you like so much about this place?
1441	b2	I really like the food here.
1442	a3	I absolutely agree. I think the food is really yummy.
1442	b3	My favourite is the roast beef open faced sandwich.
1443	a1	What time would you like me to arrive tonight?
1443	b1	Please come at 6pm
1444	a2	OK, I will see you then!
1444	b2	Great, and don't forget to bring that special package!
1445	a3	Right! Carl is going to be so excited to get a puppy for his birthday.
1445	b3	He sure is!
1446	a1	Hey Mike, Barry will be here at 7pm, are you all set and ready to go by the time he gets here?
1446	b1	Oh, do we have to go out with Barry?
1447	a2	Yes, we do.
1447	b2	But he's so weird and oddly obsessive about my dolls.
1448	a3	Only the latex ones.
1448	b3	Is that really a mitigating point?
1449	a1	Are you a baker?
1449	b1	I used to be years ago. Not so much anymore.
1450	a2	What kinds of things did you bake?
1450	b2	Mostly muffins and pies.
1451	a3	I love muffins and pies, would you make me one somtime?
1451	b3	Yeah I can do, something sweet or savory?
1452	a1	Are you almost there?
1452	b1	Not even close.
1453	a2	How far away are you?
1453	b2	A couple of miles.
1454	a3	About how long will it take you? We are running late.
1454	b3	Four minutes. That is, four minutes after I finish changing the tire.
1455	a1	Can you please fix me a meal?
1455	b1	Yes, I certainly can.
1456	a2	Thank you very much.
1456	b2	What would you like to eat?
1457	a3	I don't know, maybe some pasta!
1457	b3	Sorry, I run out of pasta. Anything else?
1458	a1	Do you need money for the bus?
1458	b1	No, but thank you for asking.
1459	a2	Well, do you need a ride then?
1459	b2	That would be great, do you have space for my case?
1460	a3	Yes, in the passenger seat.
1460	b3	Then that means I have to ride in the back like you're my chauffer.
1461	a1	Do you know how to get to my appointment ?
1461	b1	I will put the address in my GPS.
1462	a2	Don't let it direct you off a bridge.
1462	b2	Did you have a bad experience with a GPS?
1463	a3	If I did drive off a bridge, I wouldn't be here asking.
1463	b3	I've heard some GPS horror stories so you never know!
1464	a1	Do you think I will make a full recovery soon?
1464	b1	Yes ama, you will.
1465	a2	How long will my recovery take?
1465	b2	One or two months.
1466	a3	That is an awfully long time.
1466	b3	Time will fly by, don't worry
1467	a1	Can you give me a ride?
1467	b1	No, not right now maybe later.
1468	a2	But I need a ride now.
1468	b2	You will have to ask someone else.
1469	a3	Fine, thanks for nothing.
1469	b3	You're welcome for nothing!
1470	a1	Could you please help me write a letter?
1470	b1	Sure, I can help you. What type of letter do you need to write?
1471	a2	It is a letter to my lawyer.
1471	b2	Why are you writing to your lawyer?
1472	a3	I just wanted to thank him for his help.
1472	b3	What did he help you with?
1473	a1	Any news from my lawyer?
1473	b1	Yes, We have received the letter from him.
1474	a2	I'm going to the slammer, aren't I?
1474	b2	If you plead guilty, we can work a deal.
1475	a3	What do you want from me?
1475	b3	To weigh your choices. Take the deal and get it over with, or draw this out and take your chances in a trial.
1476	a1	Where is a good place to go camping?
1476	b1	Ask the ranger for a recommendation.
1477	a2	Oh ok, I was hoping you'd have a recommendation.
1477	b2	I don't go camping a lot, actually.
1478	a3	Sorry to bother you.
1478	b3	Not a bother, I'm just not a ranger.
1479	a1	Where did you park?
1479	b1	in the driveway
1480	a2	Did you park in the front of the driveway or in the back?
1480	b2	Do you need to get your car out of the garage?
1481	a3	Yes it is time for me to go to work.
1481	b3	I will move my car then.
1482	a1	Where is the nearest hospital?
1482	b1	It is about a mile and a half east of here.
1483	a2	Well hurry, I don't know long I can make it.
1483	b2	I'm going as fast as I can.
1484	a3	Just shut up and speed up!
1484	b3	Okay, okay. I don't want to get a ticket though!
1485	a1	Do you have kids?
1485	b1	Yes, I have two little boys.
1486	a2	How old are they?
1486	b2	They are 4 and 1.
1487	a3	Sounds like a handful!
1487	b3	Thankfully they are both pretty mellow.
1488	a1	Did you have that weird dream again last night?
1488	b1	Yeah. This time it was even weirder though!
1489	a2	What happened in it?
1489	b2	Let's just say the dragon got its wings.
1490	a3	What does that mean?
1490	b3	Exactly as I said the dragon got it wings and did what you'd expect anything else with wings to do which is fly.
1491	a1	Have you ever been to the Louvre?
1491	b1	No, but I would like to.
1492	a2	I would like to go as well.
1492	b2	Maybe one day we will make it.
1493	a3	I've been telling myself that for ten years!
1493	b3	It is a bit expensive, but I'm sure it would be worth it.
1494	a1	How are the pets doing?
1494	b1	They're doing great.
1495	a2	What kind of dog do you have again?
1495	b2	A golden retriever. She's a terror though!
1496	a3	Does she retrieve the wrong things?
1496	b3	She retrieves EVERYTHING!
1497	a1	Can you turn on the fan please?
1497	b1	No, because it makes me cold.
1498	a2	Get a blanket, I'm having a heat stroke over here.
1498	b2	Do you think you're going through menopause?
1499	a3	You should just get a blanket!
1499	b3	You should get a check-up!
1500	a1	Why did you come so late?
1500	b1	I forgot to set my alarm to remind me.
1501	a2	No need to shout, I was just asking.
1501	b2	Sorry, the alarm was really loud.
1502	a3	I understand no problem at all.
1502	b3	so did I miss anything?
1503	a1	How have you been?
1503	b1	Thanks, well enough.
1504	a2	That's great, really good to see you
1504	b2	It's great to see you too! How are the wife and kids?
1505	a3	They are all looking forward to summer break.
1505	b3	Well, that makes four of us!
1506	a1	Could you please help me pay my bills?
1506	b1	I am skint sorry!
1507	a2	That's okay, I'll ask my mom.
1507	b2	Good luck with that!
1508	a3	Mom always give me money because I pay her back unlike some people I know.
1508	b3	I don't know what you're talking about!
1509	a1	What is your favorite movie?
1509	b1	My favorite movie is Casablanca
1510	a2	I haven't seen that one.
1510	b2	Well what's your favourite movie?
1511	a3	The Fellowship of the Ring.
1511	b3	What is your favorite The Lord of the Rings Movie?
1512	a1	How do you turn this off?
1512	b1	Push and hold the power button.
1513	a2	Wow, that was easy.
1513	b2	Yeah, you don't need to be a brainiac to figure out the power.
1514	a3	Guess my brain's not working so great today, then.
1514	b3	We all have our moments.
1515	a1	Did you do the dishes?
1515	b1	I did the dishes this morning.
1516	a2	Ok thanks for washing the dishes up, I'll make dinner later.
1516	b2	What is for dinner?
1517	a3	We have pasta or meatloaf, which do you prefer?
1517	b3	I could go for paste.
1518	a1	Is it really hot or it's just me?
1518	b1	I'm actually fine.
1519	a2	Weird, let me turn on the fan at least.
1519	b2	Ok, no problem. I can get you some ice cream too if that would help.
1520	a3	That would be great, Black Walnut is my favorite.
1520	b3	would you like to have some vanilla also?
1521	a1	Did I have any calls today, also, who were they from?
1521	b1	You mom called earlier, I took a message for you.
1522	a2	That's it? Just my mom?
1522	b2	yes, were you expecting another call?
1523	a3	I am waiting to hear about a job.
1523	b3	Oh? Where did you apply?
1524	a1	Do you like my shirt?
1524	b1	It's really nice. That color suits you.
1525	a2	Thank you so much.
1525	b2	You're welcome! You should wear it more often.
1526	a3	You're looking pretty good yourself.
1526	b3	Aw thank you hun. I appreciate the compliment as I was debating on wearing this outfit today.
1527	a1	Did you finish your homework?
1527	b1	i dont have homework to do
1528	a2	Go mow the lawn then.
1528	b2	I don't want to.
1529	a3	Really, then I don't want to wash your clothes or fix your meals.
1529	b3	That seems fair. How about you mow the lawn, and i'll worry about feeding and clothing myself.
1530	a1	Would you mind doing the dishes?
1530	b1	Can we put them in the dishwasher?
1531	a2	Dishwasher is out of order, can you do them manually please?
1531	b2	Yes, but if we do it together it would be faster.
1532	a3	I can't right now. I have to add up to receipts.
1532	b3	Yeah, you and your receipts, why don't you marry them if you love them so much?
1533	a1	Don't you have a test tomorrow?
1533	b1	Yes, in sociology. I don't think I'm ready for it.
1534	a2	Did you have enough time to study?
1534	b2	No, I had work so I didn't get home until late.
1535	a3	You didn't get home until late because you were at the bar, remember I saw you!
1535	b3	I know that, but my professor doesn't.
1536	a1	Can I have a burger?
1536	b1	Sure, what do you want on It?
1537	a2	Only meat thank you.
1537	b2	Are you sure? That's sort of a bizarre choice.
1538	a3	Yes, trying to stick to my lifestyle aka diet.
1538	b3	You're funny! One meat burger coming right away!
1539	a1	Can I rest for a little while?
1539	b1	Sure, there's a bench right here.
1540	a2	Ah, thanks. Now that I'm better rested I will finally stop SHOUTING.
1540	b2	I appreciate that, thank you. Do you mind me asking why you seem to start all our conversations with shouting?
1541	a3	I ran out of my medication and feel really excitable. SORRY IT BOTHERS YOU SO MUCH!
1541	b3	Oh, it's JUST FINE!
1542	a1	Did the Mets win?
1542	b1	No, they never win
1543	a2	Ha, that is so true
1543	b2	The Yankees, on the other hand, are doing great.
1544	a3	Figures. Who's your favorite player?
1544	b3	Do you think the Yankees are doing great just because they are the New York fav baseball tea,?
1545	a1	Do you want to come?
1545	b1	No, I think I will pass this time.
1546	a2	Are you mad at me or something?
1546	b2	Nah, just tired of doing the same things all the time.
1547	a3	We could do something different then. I just wanted to hang out with you for awhile. What would you like to go do instead.
1547	b3	I want to go rollerskating. Would you be willing to do that?
1548	a1	Where did we order them?
1548	b1	From Office Depot, I think.
1549	a2	How much did they cost?
1549	b2	Let me find the receipt
1550	a3	I hope you didn't pay too much for them.
1550	b3	no they are not that costly.
1551	a1	How old is your dog?
1551	b1	He is 7 years old.
1552	a2	What breed is he?
1552	b2	He is a pitbull.
1553	a3	He's got the most lovely coloring!
1553	b3	Thank you, we think she's adorable too!
1554	a1	Do you have the time?
1554	b1	Yes, it's 4:20
1555	a2	I misplaced my phone and feel so lost without it.
1555	b2	I hate that.
1556	a3	I will call it and see if you can hear it.
1556	b3	OK, try it.
1557	a1	Can I have a snack?
1557	b1	Yes, you may have an apple.
1558	a2	An apple and then a piece of cake.
1558	b2	No cake. It's too close to dinner, and you'll ruin your appetite.
1559	a3	You sound like my mother.
1559	b3	And you eat like your father.
1560	a1	Why are you angry?
1560	b1	Because my team lost the game
1561	a2	Do you own the team?
1561	b2	Well no, but I've rooted for them for as long as I can remember.
1562	a3	Did something happen that was unfair?
1562	b3	That referee was just making bad calls all game long.
1563	a1	Where is the music festival taking place this year?
1563	b1	Which music festival? Do you mean Bluesfest in Ottawa?
1564	a2	Yes, that is the one I mean.
1564	b2	Oh that's a good one. Do you plan to go?
1565	a3	I sure do! How about you?
1565	b3	I wouldn't miss it for the world!
1566	a1	Can you take her?
1566	b1	I'm sorry but I can't take her.
1567	a2	What, are your arms broken?
1567	b2	Don't be rude. No, I'm just too busy.
1568	a3	Will you be able to take her later?
1568	b3	Is after work a good time? My last meeting ends at 4:30.
1569	a1	How many doors does it have?
1569	b1	It's a 4 door
1570	a2	Oh, I'm looking for a 2 door model.
1570	b2	But a 4 door will have higher resale value.
1571	a3	That's okay, I'm not really concerned about that.
1571	b3	Oh well, good luck finding what you want.
1572	a1	What do you do for work?
1572	b1	I am a social worker.
1573	a2	Really? I have thought about going into that field!
1573	b2	It's very draining, but rewarding.
1574	a3	What do like most and least about the job?
1574	b3	It drains me, but it rewards me too! Heh.
1575	a1	Did you make sure to put gas in it?
1575	b1	I'm not five, Gary.
1576	a2	You don't have to be a smart aleck.
1576	b2	Sorry, but I only forgot to fill the tank one time and that was years ago!
1577	a3	Well, you know how it is. Does it once, does it all the time.
1577	b3	You're never going to let things go, are you?
1578	a1	Where are you taking me?
1578	b1	I can't tell you that. It's a surprise!
1579	a2	I hope it's to that new restaurant on 12th.
1579	b2	You will just have to wait to find out.
1580	a3	How exciting! It's so nice that you planned a surprise for me!
1580	b3	I figure it will be the perfect time to tell you that I'm sleeping with your husband and he's leaving you.
1581	a1	Can I talk to you for just a moment?
1581	b1	Sorry, I'm busy right now.
1582	a2	Okay. Please let me know when you are free.
1582	b2	Sure, maybe after lunch.
1583	a3	ok, talk to you then.
1583	b3	i will let you knew once I am back from lunch
1584	a1	Would you like to meet for a cup of coffee?
1584	b1	Yes when is good for you?
1585	a2	Tomorrow around noon would be nice.
1585	b2	Hmmm, okay noon it is.
1586	a3	Starbucks on the corner or the new Stumptown coffee cart?
1586	b3	Starbucks, it's my coffee addiction.
1587	a1	Who do you think will win the game tonight?
1587	b1	I think the Rockets have a good chance.
1588	a2	Are you a tad bit delusional?
1588	b2	They have been on a winning streak lately.
1589	a3	Just pure luck I think.
1589	b3	It's a lot more than luck!
1590	a1	Where did you go?
1590	b1	I ran to the restroom real quick.
1591	a2	I thought you were lost.
1591	b2	No, it just took a while.
1592	a3	Please tell me next time you run off.
1592	b3	Ok, sorry, I will.
1593	a1	Do you every dream about losing your teeth?
1593	b1	I do not.
1594	a2	I had a dream where that happened the other day. It felt so real.
1594	b2	That must have been really scary!
1595	a3	It's actually really common for people to dream about losing teeth. I wonder why!
1595	b3	There are many things people dream about that may have meaning in their daily lives as well.
1596	a1	Would you like some toast?
1596	b1	Yes please, thank you!
1597	a2	You're very welcome! Would you like some Peach jelly to go with it?
1597	b2	Sure, peaches are my favorite fruit!
1598	a3	Awesome I love peaches too.
1598	b3	Do you have anything else to go with the toast?
1599	a1	Do you know how to get there?
1599	b1	No. I'm lost too
1600	a2	I'll look it up on my phone.
1600	b2	Oh great! What app are you using?
1601	a3	I am just using google maps.
1601	b3	That's fine if it gets us there!
1602	a1	Do you like Hamburgers?
1602	b1	I love hamburgers!
1603	a2	Do you put mustard on them?
1603	b2	No I prefer relish.
1604	a3	Gross. I hate relish.
1604	b3	When is the last time you tried it?
1605	a1	Could you please sweep the floor for me?
1605	b1	Of course, I'll do it as soon as I finish the kids' bedrooms.
1606	a2	Cool, thanks a lot!
1606	b2	No problem, I like sweeping.
1607	a3	I am going to work on the dishes while you do that.
1607	b3	Great. Hopefully we can get all the vacuuming done too before the kids come home.
1608	a1	What's the verdict, good or bad?
1608	b1	It was very good.
1609	a2	Oh! That's a huge relief off my chest!
1609	b2	Yes, I'm very happy with it, too.
1610	a3	I was so worried, I know you were too.
1610	b3	Now we can both rest easy.
1611	a1	Can you help me to cross the street?
1611	b1	Yes, take my hand
1612	a2	Why is your hand so cold?
1612	b2	I just got done cleaning out my freezer.
1613	a3	Hopefully my hand will help warm yours up.
1613	b3	It should. I know holding your hand always warms my heart, so that's a good start.
1614	a1	Hallo, how are you?
1614	b1	I'm good. How are you?
1615	a2	I'm good. What have you been up to lately?
1615	b2	Not too much. Getting ready for the summer.
1616	a3	Me too. It's supposed to be a hot one.
1616	b3	Yeah, that's what the weather forecast is showing.
1617	a1	Do you have any advice on the subject?
1617	b1	Unfortunately, it is not my area of expertise.
1618	a2	Who do you think I can ask for advice?
1618	b2	You should ask the Head of the Department.
1619	a3	But he smells bad.
1619	b3	Well then ask Susan.
1620	a1	Can you put on the football game?
1620	b1	No, go watch it in the other room.
1621	a2	Can I turn the volume up on the other TV?
1621	b2	Sure, just shut the door.
1622	a3	Ok. What are you going to be doing?
1622	b3	I'm going to be studying for an exam.
1623	a1	What's your favorite icecream?
1623	b1	My favorite Is chocolate.
1624	a2	Ok, I will pick some up.
1624	b2	Do you have a favorite brand name?
1625	a3	Not really, whichever will do!
1625	b3	Okay, I will just grab whatever is on sale.
1626	a1	Won't you be late for your class?
1626	b1	No, I don't have class today.
1627	a2	Oh, is it not Thursday?
1627	b2	No it is Monday.
1628	a3	For the life of me I just can't keep track of my days.
1628	b3	Monday is the one after Sunday.
1629	a1	Will you take me to the store?
1629	b1	Yes, when do we need to go?
1630	a2	How about tomorrow?
1630	b2	Would eleven be okay for you?
1631	a3	That will be fine.
1631	b3	Great I'll pick you up then.
1632	a1	Where is the dairy section?
1632	b1	You will find it just arund the corner.
1633	a2	Around the corner from what?
1633	b2	Around the corner from the cheese display.
1634	a3	Where is the cheese display?
1634	b3	The cheese display is on aisle 10.
1635	a1	How was your outing?
1635	b1	I know you don't care about my outing, Susan. Just take the check, and make sure Jenny eats this time, okay? Enough of your passive, aggressive malarkey.
1636	a2	You need to go back to those anger management classes, Derek.
1636	b2	No you need to stop talking to me and let me be.
1637	a3	I was just trying to be polite.
1637	b3	I can see right through your politeness Susan!
1638	a1	This is my new jacket, do you like it?
1638	b1	Yes, I like the color and it fits you perfectly.
1639	a2	Thank you, I got it for free.
1639	b2	That's great! How'd you do that?
1640	a3	The store I shop at let's you accumulate bonus points towards future purchases.
1640	b3	How do I sign up? thats a good deal if you shop there
1641	a1	Do we go to the same church?
1641	b1	No. I got to St. Mattress.
1642	a2	Mattress? Do you mean Mary's?
1642	b2	No. I mean I sleep in on Sundays instead!
1643	a3	Hardy har har, real funny.
1643	b3	Just a little church humor to break the tension.
1644	a1	Could the local sports team help with the fundraising event?
1644	b1	We could always contact them and find out.
1645	a2	Tell them it would be for both Saturday and Sunday.
1645	b2	Okay, do they need to be here all day or just for the afternoon?
1646	a3	We will probably need at least three people all day.
1646	b3	they will be compensated for their time with a free meal during the event.
1647	a1	Could you please open some windows and doors in order to feel the cold air?
1647	b1	No, I have the air conditioner on.
1648	a2	Well I don't think it's working.
1648	b2	Is it still too warm in here?
1649	a3	It's like a sauna in here.
1649	b3	When you start paying the bills then you can have a say in the temperature in the car.
1650	a1	Can I make an appointment?
1650	b1	No, I'm quite bussy at the moment
1651	a2	I'll come back in ten minutes.
1651	b2	Hopefully I'll be able to help you then.
1652	a3	Okay, thank you.
1652	b3	You are welcome.
1653	a1	Can we go do something?
1653	b1	Sure what do you feel like?
1654	a2	Actually, I'd like to go see a movie.
1654	b2	What movie would you like to see?
1655	a3	Something dramatic, with a lot of death and suffering, but no blood.
1655	b3	You sound in a cheerful mood! Let's see what horror movies are playing today.
1656	a1	Do you like cake?
1656	b1	Everyone likes cake, right? I definitely do.
1657	a2	My favorite cake is red velvet.
1657	b2	Nice! My favourite is carrot cake- with pineapple!
1658	a3	I wish I could eat that, but I'm allergic to pineapple.
1658	b3	I have never heard of putting pineapple on carrot cake.
1659	a1	Yes, how did you know?
1659	b1	I read it in the newspaper.
1660	a2	Which newspaper did you read it in?
1660	b2	The New York Times, paper of record!
1661	a3	If you say so.
1661	b3	Well, where do you get your news?
1662	a1	Would you like to play Monopoly?
1662	b1	Yes, I would.
1663	a2	Awesome, I'll set it up.
1663	b2	Okay! I get the puppy dog.
1664	a3	That's cool because I always take the car.
1664	b3	why do you always take the car?
1665	a1	Would you help me study Spanish please?
1665	b1	Claro que si!
1666	a2	So is that a yes?
1666	b2	I am not sure. That's the only thing I know in Spanish.
1667	a3	Seriously? I guess you won't be much help after all
1667	b3	Sorry, I only studied French!
1668	a1	Who won the baseball game?
1668	b1	The white sox
1669	a2	Awesome, glad to hear that. When do they play again?
1669	b2	Tomorrow night, and they're hosting the Yankees.
1670	a3	Are tickets still available
1670	b3	Yeah, probably, let me check online.
1671	a1	I wonder if it will rain tomorrow?
1671	b1	It is supposed to.
1672	a2	I guess I should bring my umbrella.
1672	b2	Yea, you probably should.
1673	a3	I just hope I don't lose it, like I usually do.
1673	b3	How can you lose something so big?
1674	a1	What do you want me to do?
1674	b1	Could you clean the litter boxes please?
1675	a2	I have no problem doing that. Grab me a trash bag?
1675	b2	Sure, here's one right here.
1676	a3	I'll need a bigger bag than that!
1676	b3	Sure, here's bigger one.
1677	a1	Have you seen my keys?
1677	b1	If you would put them on the key hanger like I ask you to every day then you wouldn't need to be wasting time searching for them again now.
1678	a2	I guess I have to learn the hard way.
1678	b2	Obviously. Also your keys are in your hand.
1679	a3	You're a genius. What would I do without you?
1679	b3	I guess you would just never have any keys!
1680	a1	What day is the wedding?
1680	b1	It is next Saturday. Please come if you're able.
1681	a2	I will be there.
1681	b2	Good! And wear your nice clothes.
1682	a3	You mean I can't just show up in jeans?
1682	b3	Are you serious? Who goes to wedding in jeans?
1683	a1	Who's car is outside?
1683	b1	It's my daughters friend.
1684	a2	Oh, what are they doing today?
1684	b2	They're going to her cousin's art exhibit.
1685	a3	Wow. What kind of work does she or he do?
1685	b3	She is a photographer is NYC.
1686	a1	How did you make it?
1686	b1	I followed the recipe.
1687	a2	Oh, I'm no good at following recipes.
1687	b2	It is simple, not many ingredients.
1688	a3	Well I can burn water so it may not be simple for me.
1688	b3	Burned water is one of the ingredients!
1689	a1	What's your favorite type of music?
1689	b1	Anything but country.
1690	a2	I am quite fond of Whigfield.
1690	b2	What is that? I've never heard of it.
1691	a3	Not sure myself it just came to my mind
1691	b3	Um OK. Want to go to the park with me later?
1692	a1	What do you think of the new boss?
1692	b1	I think he is a wonderful person.
1693	a2	I am not sure he likes me.
1693	b2	I think you may be right, honestly.
1694	a3	Why? Has he said something about me to you?!
1694	b3	He hasn't said anything, but the looks he gives you makes it obvious.
1695	a1	Would you like some pizza?
1695	b1	Absolutely! I love pizza!
1696	a2	How many slices?
1696	b2	I'll take all of them!
1697	a3	Great! I'll have it cut in squares.
1697	b3	Then I want all the squares!
1698	a1	What did my boss say when you gave the news?
1698	b1	He said you are fired.
1699	a2	Do you want me to talk to him?
1699	b2	Are you sure that's the best idea right now?
1700	a3	I think once the boss calms down he will see reason, don't you?
1700	b3	Yes but he will never admit he was wrong firing you
1701	a1	What is your favorite song?
1701	b1	Love lift us up where we belong.
1702	a2	I think you belong in a mental institution. Love lift you there please.
1702	b2	Ha, ha, very funny. Do you have a better favorite song?
1703	a3	Of course, Ring of Fire by the man in black.
1703	b3	Another nice choice. Let's go see if the shuffleboard room is open.
1704	a1	Are you going somewhere?
1704	b1	Yes I am, would you like to go with me?
1705	a2	Yep, let me go get dressed.
1705	b2	Wear something warm, it's cold outside.
1706	a3	Is it sweatshirt weather or should I grab a jacket?
1706	b3	No, take a jacket. You know the weather can be unpredictable right now!
1707	a1	Will Sarah come today?
1707	b1	She can't make it today.
1708	a2	Well, that is unfortunate!
1708	b2	You are telling me, I was going to sell her my old X-Box.
1709	a3	So what are we going to do now?
1709	b3	We can play on the X-box.
1710	a1	How are your grades?
1710	b1	They are ok thanks
1711	a2	Mine are freaking fantastic.
1711	b2	Good for you! How did this happen?
1712	a3	I studied instead of playing hooky all the time like you
1712	b3	Whoa! No need to be so harsh.
1713	a1	Do you still have power?
1713	b1	Yes,I am still powerful in the army
1714	a2	What rank are you in the army?
1714	b2	I'm a Captain.
1715	a3	Nice try, buddy. You just finished Basic.
1715	b3	Hey, close enough!
1716	a1	How old are you?
1716	b1	I'm old enough to know better
1717	a2	But apparently you don't know better or you wouldn't had acted that way.
1717	b2	That's true, I won't do it again.
1718	a3	We'll see about that.
1718	b3	Look, I said I am sorry and I promised I won't do it again. What else can I do?
1719	a1	Any way we can get some water?
1719	b1	Yes here you go.
1720	a2	Thank you, I appreciate it.
1720	b2	You're more than welcome.
1721	a3	This water is really good.
1721	b3	It better be, It costs 5 dollars a bottle
1722	a1	Is the volume too high for you?
1722	b1	No, it's perfect
1723	a2	So, do you like the song?
1723	b2	No, I wish they would just deport Justin Bieber already.
1724	a3	Eh, we live in the internet era. You'd still hear from him.
1724	b3	Not with web blocking apps for certain things.
1725	a1	Could you give me a hand with this?
1725	b1	Yeah what do you need me to do?
1726	a2	I need you to hold the nail while I hit it with the hammer.
1726	b2	Well sure. This hammer?
1727	a3	Do you see another one anywhere?
1727	b3	All right smarty pants, do it yourself.
1728	a1	What would you like to eat?
1728	b1	I love to eat seafood, especially shrimps!
1729	a2	Do you like them cold or hot?
1729	b2	always hot with melted butter!
1730	a3	I like to eat it cold myself.
1730	b3	You should try it with Grits!
1731	a1	When do you need to leave?
1731	b1	Pretty soon, because the concert starts in 30 minutes.
1732	a2	What are you seeing?
1732	b2	its a screamo band. You wouldn't know them.
1733	a3	Well, I'm paying for your tickets so humor me.
1733	b3	Why don't you just come with me? You might enjoy it.
1734	a1	How did you manage to come?
1734	b1	I was able to finish earlier than expected.
1735	a2	Awesome, glad you could make it.
1735	b2	Thanks, I've been looking forward to the party all week.
1736	a3	Yeah I also purchased a ton of alcohol, so you'll have to help me finish it!
1736	b3	Are all the cute guys coming to the party?
1737	a1	Will there be a seat for me?
1737	b1	As long as you don't mind sitting on my lap, yes.
1738	a2	No thank you, pervert.
1738	b2	Oh come on, I was just kidding.
1739	a3	I don't believe that you were.
1739	b3	I was definitely kidding.
1740	a1	Do you want to go have sushi tomorrow?
1740	b1	No i'd rather have pizza.
1741	a2	I just ate pizza last night. Won't you reconsider? Let's get Chinese instead.
1741	b2	Sure, Chinese sounds good. Just make sure to order extra egg rolls please.
1742	a3	Yes, we never seem to get enough egg rolls.
1742	b3	Egg rolls are the best part of ordering Chinese food.
1743	a1	How are you feeling today?
1743	b1	I have a major headache.
1744	a2	Did you get enough sleep?
1744	b2	No I couldn't sleep.
1745	a3	Have you tried Sleepytime tea?
1745	b3	No, never heard of it.
1746	a1	Where can I find it?
1746	b1	Under the car
1747	a2	Did you hide it there?
1747	b2	No, I saw it when I pulled into the driveway.
1748	a3	You should be more careful with our cat!
1748	b3	Talk to the dog. He looks suspiciously guilty.
1749	a1	What did you do today?
1749	b1	I walked the dog.
1750	a2	Good. The dog is getting really fat.
1750	b2	So are you, should I walk you next?
1751	a3	Really, you had to go there?
1751	b3	I'm sorry, just messing with you!
1752	a1	What's your favorite TV show?
1752	b1	I'll need to think about it, but I love Law & Order.
1753	a2	Those crime scene shows are so interesting!
1753	b2	I also love how I met your mother.
1754	a3	My goodness, they are so different! But I understand; I like more than one type of show, too.
1754	b3	What is your favorite TV show?
1755	a1	Are you new to this?
1755	b1	No, I've been doing it for years.
1756	a2	Do you think you're an expert yet?
1756	b2	I still have alot to learn.
1757	a3	I'd be an expert if I had been working in the same job for 35 years. What's wrong with you?
1757	b3	I guess I'm just not as good as you.
1758	a1	What time is my appointment?
1758	b1	I don't know, ring them and see.
1759	a2	Didn't I tell you to write it down?
1759	b2	I'm sorry, I forgot to do that.
1760	a3	Next time when I ask you to write something down for me, can you please do it immediately?
1760	b3	I think you should be responsible for your own life, not me.
1761	a1	Would you like to come out with me to the shops?
1761	b1	Yes, of course.
1762	a2	Is there any place you want to visit?
1762	b2	The candy shop.
1763	a3	Do you want to hit the shoe store next?
1763	b3	Sure, I need to get some new fitness trainers anyway.
1764	a1	Where are my glasses?
1764	b1	They're on the table
1765	a2	I can't see them.
1765	b2	That is so ironic!
1766	a3	Don't you think? It's like rain on your wedding day.
1766	b3	You are weird. In a good way.
1767	a1	Do you have any butter?
1767	b1	Yes I do. Sorry, I thought you were still trying to cut back so it's in the fridge.
1768	a2	Now you're telling me what I should eat?
1768	b2	No, we just hadn't talked about your diet lately.
1769	a3	Try the second shelf. I have the real stuff and the heart healthy mom likes.
1769	b3	The real stuff is always better. But I guess we should all be trying to look after our health.
1770	a1	Can you break this off?
1770	b1	No the material is too solid.
1771	a2	I wish I were strong like the hulk!
1771	b2	Hey don't we all!?
1772	a3	Sometimes, that might be a bad thing.
1772	b3	Yeah, it would have its downsides.
1773	a1	Yes, what time shall we meet?
1773	b1	We will meet at half past eleven morning.
1774	a2	What will you be wearing?
1774	b2	A red shirt with blue jeans.
1775	a3	Okay, I'll see you then.
1775	b3	what will you be wearing?
1776	a1	Any news about Tracy?
1776	b1	She just got a new job.
1777	a2	Is she still going to school as well?
1777	b2	No, she graduated last spring. She didn't send you an announcement?
1778	a3	No. Did I do something to piss her off?
1778	b3	Not that I am aware of. But you know how she is!
1779	a1	Can you call me instead?
1779	b1	No I am driving
1780	a2	Alright, when you are pulled over, just call me.
1780	b2	I will have to call you later.
1781	a3	OK, be safe on the road.
1781	b3	I will, talk to you later!
1782	a1	When is your birthday?
1782	b1	Its tomorrow! Are you going to get me a present?
1783	a2	Eh, I kind of forgot.
1783	b2	It's not too late!
1784	a3	Maybe you are right!
1784	b3	Well, there's a great book out that I want.
1785	a1	What's for breakfast tomorrow?
1785	b1	I'll probably make waffles since we have some extra time.
1786	a2	They better be homemade and not those frozen things.
1786	b2	They are homemade.
1787	a3	Do you have maple syrup?
1787	b3	Yes, you are so picky.
1788	a1	Can I get a bag with that?
1788	b1	Yes, I can bag that for you.
1789	a2	I prefer paper if you would, thanks.
1789	b2	We do offer paper instead of plastic.
1790	a3	Thank you that would be great.
1790	b3	not an issue
1791	a1	Can we not go to the store today?
1791	b1	We have to go to the store today.
1792	a2	Can we just go later?
1792	b2	I think we really need to go now.
1793	a3	Why? What do we need so urgently?
1793	b3	Water and something to eat!
1794	a1	Hello, what type of dog is that?
1794	b1	This dog is a poodle.
1795	a2	It is so cute and fluffy!
1795	b2	She just got back from the groomers.
1796	a3	Oh, which groomer do you use?
1796	b3	i went to city groomers.
1797	a1	Shall we go one day?
1797	b1	Yes, If you'd like too.
1798	a2	Are you free next weekend?
1798	b2	I'm busy Sunday but could go Saturday!
1799	a3	Great I will pick you up at 11!
1799	b3	Alright seems fine by me.
1800	a1	Can we sit outside on the porch?
1800	b1	Sure, why not? It's nice enough out.
1801	a2	It is so nice!
1801	b2	Knock on wood. I heard it might thunderstorm later today.
1802	a3	I like listening to thunderstorms, as long as there's no chance of tornado!
1802	b3	No tornadoes in the forecast today, but I have my mobile app alerts set to keep me notified.
1803	a1	How is the weather?
1803	b1	It's sunny and warm.
1804	a2	Make sure you wear sunscreen!
1804	b2	I will, of course. Don't mother me.
1805	a3	safety first! I'm just trying to help
1805	b3	I know you are, Mom. But I'm 53, and I'd just really like to be a bit more independent.
1806	a1	Do you like the color red?
1806	b1	Yes, it's my favorite color.
1807	a2	So is mine!
1807	b2	What a coincidence!
1808	a3	I have red as accent colors in all the rooms of my house, I love it so much.
1808	b3	Sounds like a nice color plan for a house.
1809	a1	Can you get me a glass of water?
1809	b1	Of course I can.
1810	a2	Can you get me one too, please?
1810	b2	Sure, anyone else?
1811	a3	I'd like some coke, or something else with flavor, if you have.
1811	b3	We don't have coke.
1812	a1	Do you want to go on a run?
1812	b1	Oh gosh NO!
1813	a2	Why are you so against running?
1813	b2	I went on a really long run yesterday so I'm beat.
1814	a3	That's alright, then. Perhaps we can schedule a run for another time?
1814	b3	Yes, another day perhaps.
1815	a1	Is that the only colour?
1815	b1	It comes In many colors.
1816	a2	Can it be multi-colored?

1824	a1	How is he doing?
1824	b1	He is doing good.
1825	a2	When's the last time you talked to him?
1825	b2	We spoke yesterday on the phone.
1826	a3	I should probably stop by today and visit him.
1826	b3	yes, he'll like that
1827	a1	Did he chase you?
1827	b1	He tried, but I outran him
1828	a2	Why did he chase you?
1828	b2	He was after my purse.
1829	a3	He was trying to steal it?
1829	b3	Yes he was
1830	a1	Have you ever visited any islands?

1833	b1	About ten miles.
1834	a2	Whats the name of the place where you live
1834	b2	Well its a house on wheels so I think it's called a trailer?
1835	a3	No silly, the name of your neighborhood.
1835	b3	Oh, sorry. I live in Meadowlark Lemming Park. Do you know where that is?
1836	a1	Is the router on?
1836	b1	Yes, it's working.
1837	a2	Can I have the passcode please?
1837	b2	I'd rather keep my password confidential. Here let me enter it instead.
1838	a3	Okay that sounds fair.
1838	b3	SO, how's it going with Glen?
1839	a1	Do you know a lot about electronics?
1839	b1	No, I don't
1840	a2	I would like to learn about electronics some day.
1840	b2	I think the local adult ed program has classes.
1841	a3	Oh really? I should check into it.
1841	b3	I hear the program is amazing
1842	a1	Can you take me outdoors?
1842	b1	yeah, next Saturday.
1843	a2	But I want to go outside right now.
1843	b2	I'm sorry, but it is going to rain.
1844	a3	I like the rain.
1844	b3	then you can go outside in the rain I'm not
1845	a1	What were you doing yesterday?
1845	b1	I can't really remember, it was an uneventful day.
1846	a2	Did you stay home all day?
1846	b2	I actually made it all the way to the mailbox.
1847	a3	You are such a lazy person.
1847	b3	Actually, I got a lot of work done on my computer.
1848	a1	Did the doctor change my medication?
1848	b1	No. There is no changes in your medication

1850	b3	Thank you for calling.
1851	a1	Can you tell me what time the concert starts at?
1851	b1	The concert starts in 2 hours.
1852	a2	I hope there's no traffic getting there.
1852	b2	Yeah me either. Traffic is a bummer.
1853	a3	Remember the last time we went to a concert, and we got stuck in traffic, and we almost missed the first set?
1853	b3	Yeah, that sucked.
1854	a1	What are you doing after work?
1854	b1	Going to the game.
1855	a2	Who do you think will win?
1855	b2	I don't care, I just want to be entertained.
1856	a3	Well that's a cynical attitude.
1856	b3	The tickets were free.
1857	a1	What is on tv tonight?
1857	b1	I think Grey's is on tonight.
1858	a2	What happened in the last episode? I couldn't watch.
1858	b2	It was so good! I don't want to spoil it for you.
1859	a3	Go ahead and spoil it, I don't know when I'll ever get to watch it.
1859	b3	Matter of fact I could use a refresher, let's watch the last episode together first then I'll DVR the current one so we can watch the new episode right after. How does that sound?
1860	a1	Where is she?
1860	b1	I think she's still at work.
1861	a2	Do you know when she is done?
1861	b2	She will be done around three.
1862	a3	In the afternoon or in the morning? You know she keeps odd hours.
1862	b3	Three in the morning today and three in the afternoon tomorrow.
1863	a1	Can you tell me the price?
1863	b1	It looks like it is $1.99.
1864	a2	I'll take three, then.
1864	b2	Okay, here is your bag.
1865	a3	Thank You, here is my money.
1865	b3	Have a nice day!
1866	a1	What's your favorite Thai dish?
1866	b1	I think it would have to be pad thai.
1867	a2	It is my favorite dish too!
1867	b2	Do you prefer it with chicken or shrimp?
1868	a3	I like both but prefer shrimp. Aren't I fun?
1868	b3	I prefer shrimp. We should cook pad Thai together sometime.
1869	a1	Are we bringing our own blankets?
1869	b1	Yes we are
1870	a2	Good! The ground will probably get cold.
1870	b2	Don't forget bug spray.
1871	a3	I got it. Do you have sun block?
1871	b3	Yes. I'll bring it.
1872	a1	Can we go out for a walk?
1872	b1	Yes, lets walk in the park.
1873	a2	It's a really nice day for it!
1873	b2	Bring a jacket though because it gets cool by the lake.
1874	a3	I have a sweater that should do.
1874	b3	And make sure to bring some water too.
1875	a1	Can you help me get to sleep?
1875	b1	I can't help you sleep, but some music might.
1876	a2	What kind of music do you think will help?
1876	b2	Listen to some classical.
1877	a3	Can you put on some Chopin?
1877	b3	Sure, how about his Nocturnes?
1878	a1	Can you give me a hand?
1878	b1	I can't lift heavy things, I told you that.
1879	a2	Look, it's not that heavy and you're the only one here.
1879	b2	OK, let me try first. But if it is too heavy, we'll have to call someone.
1880	a3	Yeah that's fine, we can ask my buff next door neighbor if all else fails!
1880	b3	Can't we just ask him now?
1881	a1	How is your health now?
1881	b1	I am feeling a lot better.
1882	a2	That's good. Did you have to see the doctor?
1882	b2	No I did not have to.
1883	a3	Did you take any medicine for it?
1883	b3	No, I didn't.
1884	a1	Where is that sound coming from?
1884	b1	It's those idiots upstairs who never shut up.
1885	a2	We need to move ASAP!
1885	b2	Yeah we do, they are so loud even on weeknights.
1886	a3	Have you confronted them or filed a complaint with the landlord?
1886	b3	Not into confrontation. I think that might only make it worse.
1887	a1	So where are they really?
1887	b1	They are hiding out back in the shed.
1888	a2	Thanks, I'll take care of them.
1888	b2	Great, because I didn't want to deal with that situation.
1889	a3	Dont worry, I'll handle them.
1889	b3	Let me know how it goes.
1890	a1	How are the kids doing?
1890	b1	They are great!
1891	a2	Do they like school?
1891	b2	As much as it's possible for a kid to like school.
1892	a3	Some kids really like school.
1892	b3	Yeah my kids do
1893	a1	Did you get any good presents?
1893	b1	Yes I did
1894	a2	Anything in particular?
1894	b2	Yes! I got tickets to a concert!
1895	a3	Awesome! Which concert?
1895	b3	The one where Pitbull is performing live.
1896	a1	Can you take my dog to the vet?
1896	b1	I would be happy to, is it alright?
1897	a2	Yes, he just need his shots.
1897	b2	What shots does he need?
1898	a3	I have no idea what they are called.
1898	b3	Well they should have a record of what he needs.
1899	a1	Will you join me for tea?
1899	b1	Yes. I'd be happy to join you for tea.
1900	a2	When would you like to go?
1900	b2	I could be ready by noon!
1901	a3	I will see you then!
1901	b3	I look forward to it.
1902	a1	Can you suggest anything on the menu?
1902	b1	I recommend the falafel and spinach burger, a little different, but to die for!
1903	a2	Ok, you order that and I'll have a double coronary with bacon.
1903	b2	Why don't you try the spinach burger with some regular fries?
1904	a3	Because that sounds just disgusting.
1904	b3	And your burger that comes with pre admission papers to the hospital doesn't sound disgusting? Let's compromise and get a club sandwich.
1905	a1	Is it raining out there?
1905	b1	No, now it's not raining, but it looks so dark outside that I think it will rain later.
1906	a2	I guess I should grab my umbrella before we leave.
1906	b2	That would be a good idea.
1907	a3	Ok, let me go grab it.
1907	b3	can you get me one too?
1908	a1	Are you free this afternoon?
1908	b1	No sorry I have plans.
1909	a2	That's too bad.
1909	b2	How about Friday afternoon we do lunch instead?
1910	a3	Sure, if it can wait till 1 pm or later.
1910	b3	Yes, it can! Let's head down to the waterfront and have lunch at that new seafood place.
1911	a1	Can you lend me a hand?
1911	b1	Yes I can
1912	a2	Thank you, could you also pass me a wrench?
1912	b2	Sure here you go
1913	a3	Thanks, how about a flashlight too?
1913	b3	What exactly are you doing?
1914	a1	It took you awhile to get here, were you busy?
1914	b1	No I just got stuck in some really bad traffic.
1915	a2	I was starting to get worried, glad you made it.
1915	b2	Me too, now I need to unwind.
1916	a3	Yeah, I bet
1916	b3	How do you propose we do that?
1917	a1	Could you help me?
1917	b1	What can I do?
1918	a2	You can start organizing the food in the pantry.
1918	b2	I'll get right to it.
1919	a3	Thank you, I appreciate it.
1919	b3	Will I put the cheese in the pantry or in the refrigerator?
1920	a1	How was your day today?
1920	b1	Terrible! How was yours?
1921	a2	What made your day terrible?
1921	b2	I failed in my Trigonometry test.
1922	a3	Did you study?
1922	b3	Yes, but I really stink at Trig.
1923	a1	Have you seen my dog?
1923	b1	I think he's in the neighbor's backyard.
1924	a2	What is he doing there?
1924	b2	Digging in the dirt.
1925	a3	I will go over to get him
1925	b3	I will come with you, that neighbor won't be thrilled when they get a look at that yard.
1926	a1	Did you get her a present?
1926	b1	Yes mam, I did.
1927	a2	Did you get anything I suggested?
1927	b2	No mam, I did not
1928	a3	What did you end up purchasing?
1928	b3	I purchased perfume that I know she likes.
1929	a1	I couldn't hear you very well, could you repeat please?
1929	b1	Sure, I said 'please pass me the salt'
1930	a2	Of course. Here you go.
1930	b2	Is the pepper nearby too?
1931	a3	It is; would you like me to pass it to you?
1931	b3	Would you please?
1932	a1	How did you do that?
1932	b1	I used a tablesaw
1933	a2	That sounds very dangerous.
1933	b2	It was very dangerous, you have to be careful not to cut your finger with the saw.
1934	a3	I think I'll leave that sort of thing to you, then!
1934	b3	OK and I'll leave the cooking to you!
1935	a1	Do you know who won?
1935	b1	The Warriors won.
1936	a2	That's great, they're on a roll.
1936	b2	That's why they're my favorite team!
1937	a3	I like the Titans, but they never do very well.
1937	b3	yes I agree, it's a good team
1938	a1	Did you watch the game last night?
1938	b1	No, I had to work. How was it?
1939	a2	Man, you missed out! It was great!
1939	b2	Ah I wish I could've seen it. I guess I could just find highlights on youtube though.
1940	a3	The highlights won't do it justice. You really missed out.
1940	b3	Ah, sorry to hear that.
1941	a1	Are you guys hungry?
1941	b1	yes, very hungry!
1942	a2	Good, go get us some lunch.
1942	b2	No you go get it, i'm busy.
1943	a3	No can do my friend, looks like we will all starve to death.
1943	b3	How about we go together to get food?
1944	a1	Do you want to eat breakfast with me?
1944	b1	Yes I do at 9 o clock.
1945	a2	What do you want to eat?
1945	b2	I would like pancakes!
1946	a3	I love pancakes. We can do that for sure!
1946	b3	Sounds great! See you then.
1947	a1	Can you get me some coffee?
1947	b1	Yup, here you go!
1948	a2	Cream and sugar, please.
1948	b2	No cream. Will milk do?
1949	a3	Milk is fine, thanks.
1949	b3	Do you still want the sugar?
1950	a1	Could you please help me pack a bag for the hospital?
1950	b1	Yes, what do you want to take?
1951	a2	I want to take everything I'll need to stay a couple of nights.
1951	b2	Okay, where can I find your toothpaste?
1952	a3	Top drawer on the right in the bathroom.
1952	b3	What else do you need?
1953	a1	Is it cold outside?
1953	b1	Yes. it's very cold
1954	a2	Shew, I hate that!
1954	b2	It's January in Michigan, of course it's cold!
1955	a3	Well, I'm from Florida! I'm used to balmy weather in January.
1955	b3	Hah, must be nice!
1956	a1	Can you edit this picture?
1956	b1	Yes. What edits did you want?
1957	a2	I would like you to place tress in front of all the people I hate.
1957	b2	Tress? I assume you mean trees?
1958	a3	No, sorry, I meant Tess, my new girlfriend.
1958	b3	Trees might work better.
1959	a1	Can you meet me at the coffeeshop?
1959	b1	Yes, what time?
1960	a2	Let's meet at 4 o'clock.
1960	b2	No good, I have a Dr's appointment around then. How about 5 o'clock?
1961	a3	I have to be at the airport at 5. How about tomorrow?
1961	b3	Why are you going to the airport? Are you leaving out of town?
1962	a1	Do you take cream or sugar?
1962	b1	Yes, just cream please.
1963	a2	Here you go.
1963	b2	Great, fresh cream is the best.
1964	a3	I'm partial to black with sugar when it's this cold.
1964	b3	I never add sugar to anything I drink.
1965	a1	Why would you do that?
1965	b1	because it is fun
1966	a2	That makes sense, not to me, but it makes sense.
1966	b2	Have you ever tried it?
1967	a3	No, it doesn't make sense to me like I said.
1967	b3	Try it anyway!
1968	a1	What time does the post office here close?
1968	b1	It closes at 4 pm
1969	a2	What time does it open tomorrow?
1969	b2	I believe it's 8am.
1970	a3	Ok thank you so much.
1970	b3	Oh real quick, sorry, I noticed you have PO Boxes. What are the rates for those a month?
1971	a1	What can I help you with?
1971	b1	Nothing at the moment.
1972	a2	Fine, be that way Felicia.
1972	b2	You don't have to be snarky about it.
1973	a3	Sorry, it's just been a REALLY long day.
1973	b3	I'm sure it has, but being rude to me isn't going to make your day any better.
1974	a1	How many people will be there?
1974	b1	I don't know.
1975	a2	Should I bring anything?
1975	b2	Yes, bring some cookies.
1976	a3	I can do that for sure!
1976	b3	I'm bringing my famous pasta salad.
1977	a1	Can I sit out in the sun?
1977	b1	Sure, just don't get sunburned
1978	a2	Can I borrow some sun block, please?
1978	b2	Get your own sun block.
1979	a3	I left mine at home, and you have plenty to share.
1979	b3	Ok, here's some.
1980	a1	What do you want to buy?
1980	b1	I want to get some clothes.
1981	a2	What kind of clothes?

1982	a3	But don't you need clothes for work?
1982	b3	well, I have clothes for work
1983	a1	Have you seen my glasses?
1983	b1	Yes, they are on top of your head.
1984	a2	I'm always doing that.
1984	b2	Can you see without them?
1985	a3	Yes they are just for reading.
1985	b3	Oh okay. I wish that mine were just for reading.
1986	a1	Did you bring a pic-nic blanket?
1986	b1	No, I thought there were benches to sit on.
1987	a2	Well there are, but that's not nearly as romantic.
1987	b2	Oh, well good thing I brought candles! That'll surely make this pic-nic romantic!
1988	a3	I hope you brought matches, because I don't have any!
1988	b3	I have a lighter!
1989	a1	Can I make you something to eat?
1989	b1	Yes please I am hungry
1990	a2	What do you want to eat?

1991	b3	Thank you very much.
1992	a1	How was your day?
1992	b1	It was long.
1993	a2	At least it's over now.
1993	b2	Well, not quite.
1994	a3	Why, what do you still have to do?
1994	b3	I still have to go home.
1995	a1	Did you see the new car I bought?
1995	b1	Yeah, it looks great. You must have worked real hard to afford it, Becky.
1996	a2	I did! It was a lot of weekends and evenings.
1996	b2	Do you think you'd be able to help me fix up my old-reliable?
1997	a3	Sure, want to start this weekend?
1997	b3	Sounds great, I will just postpone my weekend of Netflix and ice cream til later.
1998	a1	What time do you work tomorrow?
1998	b1	I have a day off tomorrow.
1999	a2	Oh great, can you give me a ride then?
1999	b2	Sure, where do you need to go?
2000	a3	I have to do to the Department of Motor Vehicles.
2000	b3	I hate the DMV, what you have to do?
2001	a1	Hey, how do I look?
2001	b1	You look very handsome.
2002	a2	Thank you. I hope these pants fit well.
2002	b2	They look great on you.
2003	a3	Do my shoes match?
2003	b3	Nah, I think you should buy some new ones.
2004	a1	How was your day?
2004	b1	It was long and boring.

2007	b1	in the car
2008	a2	Where in the car?
2008	b2	Next to my sunglasses.

2009	b3	Glove compartment probably.
2010	a1	How much sleep did you get last night?
2010	b1	I got a ton of sleep last night!
2011	a2	That's awesome, so did I!
2011	b2	I feel so rested.
2012	a3	Yeah, it sure beats watching the clock keep clicking over to the next hour.
2012	b3	I know, insomnia is so exhausting.
2013	a1	Do I know you from somewhere?
2013	b1	No. I don't believe so.
2014	a2	Gosh you look so familiar.
2014	b2	I don't know why.
2015	a3	You're face reminds of an old friend.
2015	b3	Well, I'm from Kentucky.

2017	b2	I'm really good at soccer but I'm not too bad at basketball either.

2020	b2	I really enjoy all of them.
2021	a3	Come on, I'm sure you like one flavor more than others, surely?
2021	b3	Okay then. Vanilla.
2022	a1	What made you so sick?
2022	b1	I think it was something in the water.
2023	a2	Wow, that is awful.
2023	b2	It was, I should have known not to drink the tap water
2024	a3	Well, most places have relatively clean tap water. Not your fault for assuming.
2024	b3	Next time I will boil it first!
2025	a1	I am fed up with soups, can I have some solids?
2025	b1	Once you are doing a bit better yes.
2026	a2	I feel better already.
2026	b2	Okay, we'll let's give it one more day.
2027	a3	Can't we try just a little? See how it goes?
2027	b3	It is better to wait just one more day, for your own good.
2028	a1	Is there an accessible washroom nearby?
2028	b1	Yes there Is, down the hall.
2029	a2	Thank you very much.
2029	b2	You are very welcome.
2030	a3	Have a nice day!
2030	b3	I hope you do too!
2031	a1	What did you do today?
2031	b1	Work work and more work
2032	a2	Sounds boring, but that's how it went for me as well.
2032	b2	Sometimes boring is better!
2033	a3	I'm not a fan of boring, makes the day seem longer.
2033	b3	You're right, we should just work all the time so we don't get bored.
2034	a1	What's your favorite time of day?
2034	b1	Dusk is my favorite time of day.
2035	a2	I prefer dawn because it makes me think of new beginnings.
2035	b2	I'm not a morning person at all.
2036	a3	I'm the opposite; I'm not a night person.
2036	b3	They do say opposites attract, right?
2037	a1	Where is my purse?
2037	b1	In your room.
2038	a2	Are you sure? I can't find it in there.
2038	b2	It's under your jacket!
2039	a3	No need to yell at me; it was only a question!
2039	b3	I know, but you lose stuff all the time.
2040	a1	What was your favorite place to go as a child?
2040	b1	I loved going to visit my uncle.
2041	a2	What was your uncle like?
2041	b2	He was so nice, and he always had candy.
2042	a3	I think you just liked the candy he had to give you!
2042	b3	Well, that and those horses he had.
2043	a1	How fast are you going?
2043	b1	Not fast at all
2044	a2	I asked how fast you were going, you didn't answer the question.
2044	b2	Not fast at all.
2045	a3	Stop the car. I'm getting out before you kill us both.
2045	b3	I am under the speed limit, for goodness sake! You always flip out when I'm driving!
2046	a1	What is your number?
2046	b1	I am not giving you my number!
2047	a2	C'mon! I'm not going to give it out to anyone!
2047	b2	I don't share personal info with strangers.
2048	a3	What are you talking about? We've known each other for three weeks.
2048	b3	Ask me again in another three weeks.
2049	a1	What movie do you want to watch?
2049	b1	I'll watch anything, just no musicals.
2050	a2	Have you watched Finding Nemo?
2050	b2	Do they sing at all?
2051	a3	I think Dory does, I can't remember
2051	b3	That sounds terrible!
2052	a1	What time does the game start?
2052	b1	It starts at 6:00pm.
2053	a2	Do you think it'll be a good one?
2053	b2	Definitely. Did you see the last game between them?
2054	a3	Yes, that's why I am concerned.
2054	b3	Do you want to go watch at the bar?
2055	a1	What are you doing tonight?
2055	b1	You know what I'm doing tonight!
2056	a2	Are you just staying home to watch television?
2056	b2	yep , that wht I am doing. thats what I always do.
2057	a3	Well you can go out with me if you want instead.
2057	b3	You party a little too hard for me.
2058	a1	Hey, what do you want to eat tonight?
2058	b1	Tuna and rice
2059	a2	You were offered anything you want to eat tonight, and you are going to pick tuna and rice?
2059	b2	It's been a while since we have had that.
2060	a3	what kind of tuna? What kind of rice?
2060	b3	The usual kind, I guess!
2061	a1	What's your favourite time of the year?
2061	b1	My favorite time of the year is summer
2062	a2	I find summers to be too hot.
2062	b2	Some like it hot!
2063	a3	I prefer winter more.
2063	b3	No way, the winter is too dark and dismal for me.
2064	a1	Can we eat later?
2064	b1	No I have already made plans to go out with Bob.
2065	a2	Why do you want to go out with Bob? He always stiffs you with the bill and doesn't use utensils.
2065	b2	I feel bad telling him no.
2066	a3	You are just too kind.
2066	b3	Being too kind isn't a fault for me. It's better to be kind than mean.
2067	a1	Can you take me to my appointment at ten tomorrow?
2067	b1	No, we're all booked up tomorrow. I'll call if there's an opening in the schedule.
2068	a2	All right, thank you.
2068	b2	Can I have your number?
2069	a3	Did I not give it to you already?
2069	b3	I just want to make sure I have it down right.
2070	a1	Do you prefer yellow or green?
2070	b1	I like green more than yellow.
2071	a2	I do too.
2071	b2	Never mind, I like yellow more than green
2072	a3	Not me. I still like green.
2072	b3	Do you have a favorite yellow flower?
2073	a1	Can you bring me a sweater?
2073	b1	Which one do you want?
2074	a2	The Red one, with the fringe.
2074	b2	Sorry I washed that today, it's in the dryer.
2075	a3	I'll go get it then.
2075	b3	Not if I get it first!
2076	a1	Can we go to brunch?
2076	b1	When would you like to go?
2077	a2	I want to go now; I can eat a cow!
2077	b2	Where do you want to go?
2078	a3	We should try the new restaurant at the oceanfront!
2078	b3	Not sure they would have a cow.
2079	a1	Do you think you'll go on vacation this year?
2079	b1	I am actually planning a trip to go away this fall.
2080	a2	That's great, where do you plan on going?
2080	b2	I'm thinking of going backpacking as a tourist through Afghanistan with my wife.
2081	a3	That's dumb, but have fun
2081	b3	It actually isn't as dangerous as people think.
2082	a1	What's your favorite type of food?
2082	b1	If I had to choose, probably sushi.
2083	a2	Awesome! That's mine too!
2083	b2	I really love California rolls.
2084	a3	Those are also one of my favorites!
2084	b3	Do you have a favorite sushi restaurant?
2085	a1	Did you hear about the hotel fire yesterday?
2085	b1	No! Which hotel?
2086	a2	The Motel 6 by the freeway burnt down!
2086	b2	No way, that's horrible!
2087	a3	Luckily no one was hurt.
2087	b3	What caused the fire?
2088	a1	Any thing going out today?
2088	b1	A small stack of letters and one package.
2089	a2	Add this package to the pile.
2089	b2	Why are you mailing a package this large?
2090	a3	Trust me, you don't want to know!
2090	b3	Okay, keep it a secret then. I don't care.
2091	a1	How often do you exercise?
2091	b1	I exercise everyday.
2092	a2	How long do you workout?
2092	b2	As long as I can until my energy is depleted.
2093	a3	What do you do for exercise?
2093	b3	I start with some cardio and end with strength training.
2094	a1	Can I ride to the polling place with you?
2094	b1	Sure, I'll pick you up.
2095	a2	What time are you going?
2095	b2	I want to go right after lunch. Does that work for you?
2096	a3	What time is that specifically? I have a few things going on.
2096	b3	At 2pm. Is that a good time for you?
2097	a1	When are we leaving for your uncle's house?
2097	b1	We will leave very shortly.
2098	a2	How long will we be on the road?
2098	b2	It's about three hours if we don't stop for anything.
2099	a3	We should take a break on the way though, safety first!
2099	b3	There's a good midway stopping place.
2100	a1	Have we bumped into each other before?
2100	b1	Not that I recall
2101	a2	I guess you just have a familiar face.
2101	b2	That must be it.
2102	a3	Can I buy you a drink?
2102	b3	Sure, and maybe one for my husband, he just went to the restroom.
2103	a1	Can you take me to the physiotherapist?
2103	b1	Okay please get in my car.
2104	a2	I'll need your help to get in the car.
2104	b2	What do I need to do?
2105	a3	Just hold my arm so I don't fall.
2105	b3	Here you go, take your time.
2106	a1	Are you going to church on Sunday?
2106	b1	Of course, I go every Sunday.
2107	a2	What church do you go to?
2107	b2	I go to the old catholic church downtown.
2108	a3	That thing is going to fall in one day.
2108	b3	I hope not, but it is very old
2109	a1	What haven't you tried?
2109	b1	the raw beef entree
2110	a2	Why don't you order it, and if you don't like it, we can swap plates?
2110	b2	Ok, that's very nice of you.
2111	a3	I know; I'm the sweetest guy on earth.
2111	b3	I wouldn't go that far.
2112	a1	Where are you going by the way?
2112	b1	That is none of your concern, I do not know you.
2113	a2	oh, sorry. I thought you were someone else.
2113	b2	I hope you find that someone to be extremely attractive.
2114	a3	Anyone would be more attractive than you!
2114	b3	Right back at you, buster.
2115	a1	How high can you jump?
2115	b1	I can't jump very high at all.
2116	a2	Neither can I really.
2116	b2	I used to be able to , until I got old.
2117	a3	How old ARE you?
2117	b3	Just turned 8 and a half last week!
2118	a1	Would you please mail these letters for me?
2118	b1	I'll go to the post office on my lunch break.
2119	a2	Are you sure? The queue can be really long at lunchtime.
2119	b2	That's a good point, I'll drop them in the postbox on my way home from work.
2120	a3	Oh, could you pick up dinner on the way home too?
2120	b3	Sure. What do you want for dinner?
2121	a1	Can I borrow your computer?
2121	b1	No, I need it for work.
2122	a2	Please, I'll pay you.
2122	b2	Just buy your own computer. I need mine.
2123	a3	But I'm totally broke, maybe I'll steal one from school!
2123	b3	Why don't you use the library PC?
2124	a1	Is there a pharmacy nearby?
2124	b1	Yes, on Main Street.
2125	a2	Oh great, thank you.
2125	b2	What do you need?
2126	a3	Just a few essentials and I don't want to drive too far.
2126	b3	you can order online if you don't want to drive.
2127	a1	Can we go to the park?
2127	b1	Yes, this evening.
2128	a2	What time exactly?
2128	b2	Does six work for you?
2129	a3	Yea, I think I can make it at six.
2129	b3	See you then!
2130	a1	Where is the hotel?
2130	b1	It is in downtown right by the convention center.
2131	a2	Oh, cool. Thanks!
2131	b2	Are you going to book it online?
2132	a3	Yes, I'm going to do that right now.
2132	b3	Book two rooms.
2133	a1	Can you set my alarm clock?
2133	b1	I will set it for 8 o clock.
2134	a2	Can you set it for 7:30 instead?
2134	b2	Is that your final answer?
2135	a3	Yes because I don't want to oversleep.
2135	b3	Okay well don't yell at me in the morning if you are grumpy and tired.
2136	a1	Can I borrow a pencil?
2136	b1	Sure, but you will need to sharpen it.
2137	a2	You don't have a mechanical pencil?
2137	b2	No, the lead always breaks off those.
2138	a3	Do you have a sharpener I can borrow as well?
2138	b3	Ironically, my sharpener broke last week and I haven't had a chance to buy a new one.
2139	a1	What are your plans for later?
2139	b1	I think I'm just going to stay in and watch a movie.
2140	a2	Sounds good. What movie are you going to watch?
2140	b2	I think I'll watch Harry Potter.
2141	a3	Have you read the Harry Potter books?
2141	b3	No, I haven't read a single one.
2142	a1	Where are you going?
2142	b1	I'm going home.
2143	a2	I would like to go with you.
2143	b2	Sure you can come along.
2144	a3	What will you do when you get home?
2144	b3	I don't know yet, probably watch TV.
2145	a1	Did you run out of minutes on your phone again?
2145	b1	Yes,I find it difficult to keep track of my credit balance.
2146	a2	You should get a plan with more minutes.
2146	b2	First I need a job with more paycheck.
2147	a3	Welcome to my life!
2147	b3	Seems like it's going around!
2148	a1	What have you done today?
2148	b1	I woke up and ate breakfast.
2149	a2	What did you have?
2149	b2	Bacon and eggs. You?
2150	a3	I had a poached egg on wheat toast and a banana.
2150	b3	Sounds so filling
2151	a1	Are out of your mind?
2151	b1	At this point, I think I may be.
2152	a2	Has this been going on long?
2152	b2	Since the daffodils started telling me their secrets.
2153	a3	Maybe we need to have you take a long rest. Vacation time!
2153	b3	May I bring my daffodils with me?
2154	a1	Do you think I will need to wear a coat when I go outside?
2154	b1	Yes, because if you don't you'll die.
2155	a2	Why, What's out there?
2155	b2	The cold the cold is outside.
2156	a3	Well, yeah, but, is it really that bad today?
2156	b3	It is really that cold
2157	a1	Was it on this side of the street or the other?
2157	b1	No, it was further down on the next block.
2158	a2	Let me know when you think we are close.
2158	b2	You'll see a brightly lit sign. You can't miss it.
2159	a3	You would be surprised at how easy I get lost and will miss the sign.
2159	b3	Oh, there it is. You missed it.
2160	a1	Your next appointment with who?
2160	b1	It's with my cardiologist.
2161	a2	Is everything okay? That doesn't sound good.
2161	b2	Yeah, no worries, you just got my heart a beating baby!
2162	a3	That's the cheesiest line I've ever heard.
2162	b3	Are you really going to see your cardiologist?
2163	a1	What would you like?
2163	b1	I'd like a cheeseburger and fries.
2164	a2	Awesome! Please step to the side and your order will be out in five minutes.
2164	b2	Excuse me, but I think you forgot to give me change.
2165	a3	You paid with your credit card, sir, there is no change.
2165	b3	I don't like your tone there, missy. I want to speak to the manager!
2166	a1	What did you get your Mother for Mother's Day?
2166	b1	a bouquet of red roses
2167	a2	I bet she really liked that!
2167	b2	They are her favourite.
2168	a3	Waitaminute, you told me your mother died last year!
2168	b3	She did. I brought them to her grave.
2169	a1	Would you be interested in this?
2169	b1	Why yes, I would be interested in this book.
2170	a2	What interests you most about this book?
2170	b2	I read a favorable review.
2171	a3	Are you familiar with the author?
2171	b3	yes I am
2172	a1	what did you learn in school today?
2172	b1	That people got dysentery and died.
2173	a2	Good thing dysentery isn't common anymore.
2173	b2	It could always come back.
2174	a3	Well, it's pretty unlikely
2174	b3	I'm thankful for that fact!
2175	a1	What church do you attend?
2175	b1	The Methodist church
2176	a2	What do you like about that church?
2176	b2	I like that they don't expect me to give them money.
2177	a3	You really should tithe at least, though.
2177	b3	I do when I can.
2178	a1	Do you feel better?
2178	b1	No, I feel worse
2179	a2	Do you need anything?
2179	b2	Yes, some aspirin please.
2180	a3	I only have Tylenol. Is that OK?
2180	b3	Yes, Tylenol will be fine.
2181	a1	What is your name?
2181	b1	My name is Rey.
2182	a2	Nice to meet you Rey, anything I can do for you while I am here?
2182	b2	Yeah thanks, could you get me the menu and a club soda?
2183	a3	Absolutely, I will be right back.
2183	b3	Great, thank you.
2184	a1	How's you mother doing?
2184	b1	She is quite well now.
2185	a2	That's good! I was worried about her!
2185	b2	Yeah she's doing a lot better thanks for asking.
2186	a3	When will they release her from the hospital?
2186	b3	In another three days.
2187	a1	How was your trip?
2187	b1	It was great! We had a good time.
2188	a2	When did you get back?
2188	b2	Late Tuesday night.
2189	a3	Where all did you end up going?
2189	b3	We drove cross country and stopped at a lot of places. Do you want to see my photos?
2190	a1	Why are you talking to me like that?
2190	b1	Because you're not listening!
2191	a2	I think you are being extremely rude.
2191	b2	You're not listening to me! That's rude!
2192	a3	Look here mister, I am listening to you. It is not my fault if you don't make any sense when speaking.
2192	b3	You need to calm down and take a deep breath.
2193	a1	Hey, do you know if there's a sale at that trendy clothing store today?
2193	b1	No there are never sales in that store.
2194	a2	That's unfortunate, they have so many great pieces in there.
2194	b2	I know. I too wish they had a sale someday.
2195	a3	What if I told you there was a sale today? Would you go?
2195	b3	Of course I would!
2196	a1	What should we get dad for Father's Day?
2196	b1	What about a robot vacuum cleaner?
2197	a2	Or a golf gift certificate
2197	b2	Dad hates golf. What's wrong with you?
2198	a3	Sorry, I was having a flashback to the war.
2198	b3	Did you golf during the war?
2199	a1	I like music, could you play some CDs for me?
2199	b1	You want country or pop?
2200	a2	I would prefer some old school country, please.
2200	b2	I have a blue grass CD, will that work?
2201	a3	Sure, let's try that.
2201	b3	My grandpa got me into bluegrass.
2202	a1	What time is dinner?
2202	b1	Dinner tonight is at 7 pm.
2203	a2	What are you making?
2203	b2	Are you kidding me? It's your turn to make dinner!
2204	a3	No it's not! I made dinner last night!
2204	b3	Can you please make it tonight? I'm so tired from working all day.
2205	a1	Can you send me a picture of the assignment?
2205	b1	Yes, I will email it to you later.
2206	a2	Great, Thank you!
2206	b2	Let me know when you get the email.
2207	a3	I will. Do you think this assignment will take long to do?
2207	b3	Depends on how well you know the topic.
2208	a1	Can you arrange a meeting?
2208	b1	Yes how about right now?
2209	a2	That's even better! Go ahead and grab a seat.
2209	b2	Okay, I'll be in conference room number one.
2210	a3	Oh and don't forget we will be talking about the surprise party.
2210	b3	what surprise party?
2211	a1	Do you want to stay?
2211	b1	No, I miss my home.
2212	a2	Please don't go, I'll miss you.
2212	b2	I'll come to visit you every weekend.
2213	a3	Well okay then, I guess I'll cope.
2213	b3	You should try and visit me whenever you can also.
2214	a1	Can you take me somewhere?
2214	b1	Where do you want to go?
2215	a2	The supermarket near the mall.
2215	b2	Which one, Cubs or Lunds?
2216	a3	I want to go to Lunds because it's cheaper
2216	b3	What do you want to buy anyway?
2217	a1	What kind of mascara are you wearing?
2217	b1	Maybe it's Maybelline.
2218	a2	Was it very expensive?
2218	b2	Not at all, about seven dollars. Good value.
2219	a3	Seven dollars? I just use charcoal that I get for free from the refinery.
2219	b3	If you keep using it, you might get serious health issues.
2220	a1	Have you met them yet?
2220	b1	Yes but only briefly
2221	a2	They're very nice people.
2221	b2	I thought so too!
2222	a3	OK, but you really don't have to yell.
2222	b3	Sorry I just get excited.
2223	a1	Where did you find it?
2223	b1	I found it under the couch.
2224	a2	Let me have it please. Those belong to me.
2224	b2	OK, but I think the dog chewed it some.
2225	a3	What! I knew that dog has had it out for me!
2225	b3	Oh come on! He is just a dog!
2226	a1	Do you want to eat at home?
2226	b1	No, I would rather go out.
2227	a2	Please, we could stay home and eat in bed.
2227	b2	That just sounds silly.
2228	a3	I am silly. Silly for you, you goof.
2228	b3	I love you.
2229	a1	What is your favorite dish?
2229	b1	I love calzones.
2230	a2	I love calzones also.
2230	b2	Have you tried them at the new pizzeria by the mall?
2231	a3	Yes! Unfortunately, they made me break out in hives.
2231	b3	Oh no, that's terrible!
2232	a1	How is the weather outside?
2232	b1	It's nice and sunny
2233	a2	Awesome! My favorite weather!
2233	b2	Shall we head over to the water park?
2234	a3	Yes, just give me a few minutes to get my bathing suit.
2234	b3	Don't forget a change of clothes too.
2235	a1	Did you see the match today?
2235	b1	Yes I did
2236	a2	It was so boring.
2236	b2	Agreed. I almost fell asleep.
2237	a3	I hope the next one is more exciting. Who is he playing against then?
2237	b3	I don't know, some new guy.
2238	a1	What if I don't make it?
2238	b1	You will, you will be just fine.
2239	a2	Okay I will try.
2239	b2	You can call me if you have any problems.
2240	a3	But you never answer my voicemails.
2240	b3	That's because no one uses voicemail anymore.
2241	a1	Would you like to go to get coffee?
2241	b1	Yes, I could use a good cup of coffee
2242	a2	Do they have food at the coffee shop?
2242	b2	Sure, but it's honestly not very good.
2243	a3	Good to know, is there another place that has good coffee and food?
2243	b3	The restaurant up town has amazing food
2244	a1	What's your favorite food?
2244	b1	I like any type of Asian food.
2245	a2	Can you be a little specific? I was planning a surprise!
2245	b2	Thai food is always welcome.
2246	a3	I love Thai food too! Have you been to Thailand?
2246	b3	I've never left the country!
2247	a1	How did you like the movie?
2247	b1	It was a bit boring but it had its moments.
2248	a2	Oh yeah? What was your favorite part in the movie?
2248	b2	There was a funny scene where they were making jokes in the car
2249	a3	That doesn't seem too exciting.
2249	b3	It was a more a feel-good family movie than an sction-packed thriller.
2250	a1	When do your holidays begin?
2250	b1	In about four weeks.
2251	a2	Where are you planning to go in holidays?
2251	b2	I will probably go to Hawaii.
2252	a3	Have you been there before?
2252	b3	No, this is the first time that I will visit Hawaii.
2253	a1	Can I go to bed?
2253	b1	Yes you can. See you in the morning.
2254	a2	Aren't you coming with me?
2254	b2	In a little while.
2255	a3	OK but if you change your mind I'll be reading for awhile.
2255	b3	Sounds good, I'll join you soon.
2256	a1	Where are we going?
2256	b1	I thought we'd stop by that little candle shop that you like.
2257	a2	Oh, thank-you so much! You know me so well!
2257	b2	What is your favorite scent of candle?
2258	a3	I really like sandalwood.
2258	b3	They have a new scent called carnival.
2259	a1	Are you going on a date?
2259	b1	Yes! Finally a night out with my hubby!
2260	a2	Where are you two going to do?
2260	b2	We are going to the movies.
2261	a3	What movie are you going to see?
2261	b3	We haven't decided, we usually discuss what to see over dinner.
2262	a1	Where is a good place to eat around here?
2262	b1	There's a great casual place not far from here. The food is good and it's cheap.
2263	a2	What type of food do they have?
2263	b2	It's an Asian-French fusion restaurant. It was highly rated by a local blogger.
2264	a3	Wait, was this the same blogger who recommended the Thai place?
2264	b3	Yes she is amazing
2265	a1	Do you know if they are still accepting applications?
2265	b1	No, the deadline was yesterday.
2266	a2	Oh no, I missed it!
2266	b2	Sucks to be you.
2267	a3	I see you came in as runner up in the Compassion Awards.
2267	b3	Well, what can I say, if I weren't so modest I would be perfect.
2268	a1	What did you say?
2268	b1	I asked you what you did today.
2269	a2	I went jogging.
2269	b2	Where did you go?
2270	a3	Around the new development, They have a nice park there.
2270	b3	Really? That's great!
2271	a1	Would you be so kind as to bring me my slippers?
2271	b1	They are literally two inches from your feet. Quit being so lazy.
2272	a2	Watch your mouth, young lady!
2272	b2	Maybe I would if you could do anything without ordering me around.
2273	a3	Ill order you around all I please!
2273	b3	Yeah, and you won't get your slippers, though!
2274	a1	What are we having for lunch?
2274	b1	I'm making grilled cheese on wheat, and tomatoe soup.
2275	a2	That's not lunch,that's a appetizer
2275	b2	Then you can make your own lunch!
2276	a3	Ok, I will!
2276	b3	and correct your grammar while you're at it.
2277	a1	Do you know where the remote is?
2277	b1	No but try checking underneath or between the couch cushions.
2278	a2	It always seems to end up there.
2278	b2	Grab any loose change you find.
2279	a3	No problem, I was going to do that anyway.
2279	b3	Also grab anything you find in there.
2280	a1	Can we go to Six Flags?
2280	b1	Six Flags is for chumps. Real men do it Disney.
2281	a2	Why don't you like Six Flags?
2281	b2	People die there.
2282	a3	Are you sure people don't die at Disney?
2282	b3	People unfortunately have died on Disney rides, haven't you read the media?
2283	a1	Do you have a dog?
2283	b1	Yes, I have 4 dogs
2284	a2	How much food do you need to buy a week?
2284	b2	More than I buy my family.
2285	a3	I bet that gets expensive.
2285	b3	You bet. dog food is expensive.
2286	a1	Can we go out for a drive?
2286	b1	Yeah go start the car
2287	a2	Would you like to go to a movie after the drive?
2287	b2	I just have too much work to do tonight, sorry.
2288	a3	How about a movie tomorrow night?
2288	b3	I have to work tomorrow night, but we can go this weekend.
2289	a1	Could you please help me find someone to shovel my sidewalks?
2289	b1	I can put an ad up for you.
2290	a2	I would appreciate that. I pay well.
2290	b2	How much is well to you?
2291	a3	at least $20
2291	b3	That sounds about right!
2292	a1	Is your daughter still in girl scouts?
2292	b1	NO she got bored of it.
2293	a2	I would think so. She's 27 isn't she?
2293	b2	Haha. 8 going on 27!
2294	a3	She's growing up way too fast!
2294	b3	So what's she interested in lately?

2295	b1	I have 3 total pets.
2296	a2	What kinds of pets are they?
2296	b2	I have 2 dogs and a cat.
2297	a3	And they get along?
2297	b3	They are best friends.
2298	a1	Can you help me?
2298	b1	Of course, what do you need me to do?
2299	a2	Reach that bottle of wine on the top shelf.
2299	b2	What are going to do with the wine?
2300	a3	I'm going to use It In the food I'm making for dinner
2300	b3	Please stop yelling silly.
2301	a1	How was your night?
2301	b1	it was okay
2302	a2	Did you sleep well?
2302	b2	Pretty well, but I had some bad dreams.
2303	a3	That's never fun.
2303	b3	Well yeah, but now that I'm awake I can go on with my day.
2304	a1	Could you please turn off the television?
2304	b1	No, this is my favorite show
2305	a2	Please, I don't want to watch it.
2305	b2	I'll put it on the DVR, but you don't know what you're missing.
2306	a3	It's been a long day. Maybe I'll watch it with you later.
2306	b3	So what do you want to do in the meantime?
2307	a1	Where is my daughter today?
2307	b1	She's with her grandparents.
2308	a2	What are they doing?
2308	b2	I think they're going to the zoo!
2309	a3	I hope she has fun.
2309	b3	She always has fun with her grandparents.
2310	a1	Who is coming today?
2310	b1	Your Dad is coming to visit you.
2311	a2	Is he mad at me?
2311	b2	I don't think he is mad. Should he be mad at you?
2312	a3	Well last time we talked he seemed kind of short with me.
2312	b3	Everyone seems short with you when you're 6'6. Ha ha.
2313	a1	Will you help me?
2313	b1	Yes definitely I will help you.
2314	a2	Thanks, can you just hold this right there?
2314	b2	Yes, sure. I've got it.
2315	a3	Let me know if it gets too heavy for you.
2315	b3	It's too heavy!
2316	a1	Will you please feed the dog?
2316	b1	Sure why not
2317	a2	He requires water too!
2317	b2	I know, I'll give him water.
2318	a3	He'll love you forever once you've fed him.
2318	b3	I might plan to take him home with me.
2319	a1	Can you please get me something to eat?
2319	b1	Yes I can get you something now.
2320	a2	Thanks, I just need a snack.
2320	b2	How about some peanuts?
2321	a3	Sure, that sounds great.
2321	b3	Do you like salted, unsalted, or flavoured?
2322	a1	How do you like your food?
2322	b1	It was good.
2323	a2	Would you recommend it to a friend?
2323	b2	I sure would.
2324	a3	Then I'll go and get some tomorrow.
2324	b3	I am sure you will enjoy the food too.
2325	a1	Who do you want to win the match?
2325	b1	I always root for the underdog.
2326	a2	So who is the underdog here?
2326	b2	For me it has to be the Hawks, they've lost every game this season.
2327	a3	Sounds like a true underdog to me.
2327	b3	I even made a 50 dollar bet on them.
2328	a1	Are the phone lines down?
2328	b1	Yes, I noticed we were having trouble. I saw the neighbor who told me the lines were down when I went to check the mail.
2329	a2	I'll have to call the office tomorrow then.
2329	b2	They are not open tomorrow, it's a holiday.
2330	a3	Duh, I can just use my cell phone.
2330	b3	Oh, that's right!
2331	a1	Is she into dudes?
2331	b1	I don't know her like that.
2332	a2	I hope she is, I am really into her.
2332	b2	Why don't you invite her to the party this weekend?
2333	a3	I would love to, but I'm supposed to bring my girlfriend.
2333	b3	So you have a girlfriend and you're looking at other women?
2334	a1	What is for dinner?
2334	b1	Pizza rolls and whiskey.
2335	a2	That sounds great, shall I bring something too?
2335	b2	Not unless you want to.
2336	a3	Well I did buy this nasty new outfit if you'd like to see it.
2336	b3	I would love to.
2337	a1	What movie would you like to watch?
2337	b1	Pirates of the Carribbean.
2338	a2	Not that crappy movie
2338	b2	It's an underrated cult classic!
2339	a3	Right but you watch it at least once a week and quote it all of the time. It's getting old.
2339	b3	The classics never get old!
2340	a1	How long have you been speaking English?
2340	b1	About 10 years.
2341	a2	Wow. Your English is very good.
2341	b2	Thank you, I try really hard to keep improving.
2342	a3	I would like to learn another language as well.
2342	b3	You should! It takes a while but if you do it every day it's easier.
2343	a1	How could you break it so easily?
2343	b1	It was an accident.
2344	a2	You should be more careful.
2344	b2	I'm sorry, it won't happen again.
2345	a3	be careful, don't do such thigs again
2345	b3	I was , it just slipped
2346	a1	Is the heat on?
2346	b1	It's on, but to hot.
2347	a2	Yes, I agree. Let's go turn it down a notch.
2347	b2	Not too cold, please.
2348	a3	I set it to 70 degrees. It was on 75 degrees.
2348	b3	I literally just told not too cold, were you even listening?
2349	a1	What is your house wine?
2349	b1	It's a delicious white wine and we're on the last bottle. Would you like some?
2350	a2	Yes, please bring me a glass.
2350	b2	I recommend taking the bottle if you like it.
2351	a3	How much is it for the bottle?
2351	b3	Take it as a gift from me.
2352	a1	Can I get you something to drink?
2352	b1	Yes, I will take a cold soda if you have one.
2353	a2	I have soda, would you like to have extra ice cubes?
2353	b2	Just a few in a glass would be fine
2354	a3	Okay, here you go.
2354	b3	Thank you dear.
2355	a1	When is the movie?
2355	b1	Use your phone, Steve. Seriously.
2356	a2	Yeah, come on Steve, get your act on.
2356	b2	My cell battery's dead. Just google the movie theater for me.
2357	a3	Ugh, okay. First world problems, huh?
2357	b3	Gotta love technology!
2358	a1	What is your name?
2358	b1	My name is Bob. What's yours?
2359	a2	My name is Simon. I was named after the chipmunk.
2359	b2	Simon is the smart one, right?
2360	a3	No, Simon was the dumb one.
2360	b3	Well, he was the funny one too. Haha!
2361	a1	Why are you doing this?
2361	b1	It makes me happy
2362	a2	It doesn't really, does it?
2362	b2	No, I'm serious, it actually does.
2363	a3	You enjoy the weirdest things.
2363	b3	Why yes I do
2364	a1	Will you help me?
2364	b1	I do not have time today
2365	a2	That's okay. What about tomorrow?
2365	b2	Sure, tomorrow is fine.
2366	a3	Are you available at three PM?
2366	b3	Yes I am. Should we meet at your house?
2367	a1	What are doing later tonight?
2367	b1	I have to go home and study for the big exam tomorrow.
2368	a2	I think I will do the same!
2368	b2	You want to study together?
2369	a3	Sure! Sounds like a plan.
2369	b3	Cool, you're so smart! I can't wait.
2370	a1	Hey where did you get that?
2370	b1	I got it at a thrift store in Austin.
2371	a2	very unique! I wish I knew where to get one!
2371	b2	They had several in Austin. You should try there.
2372	a3	But I live in Hong Kong!
2372	b3	They have airplanes, you know.
2373	a1	Have you seen our cat?
2373	b1	I saw him in the garden earlier.
2374	a2	Did he look hungry at all?
2374	b2	No he was busy stalking my dog as we crossed into your yard.
2375	a3	Would you mind if I looked in your yard to see if he is there?
2375	b3	You are already standing in my yard, and there's clearly no cat here.
2376	a1	Can I claim personal injury?
2376	b1	I suppose you can.
2377	a2	My back really hurts from falling off the ladder.
2377	b2	Well maybe you shouldn't climb ladders when you're drunk.
2378	a3	That's probably a good idea.
2378	b3	Yeah, it is a good idea. Haha.
2379	a1	May I have another?
2379	b1	Yes you may.
2380	a2	Is it okay to give one to Bobby too?
2380	b2	I don't mind at all, but give him the smashed one.
2381	a3	Why not give him the other one that is not smashed?
2381	b3	Because I feel like being mean to him today.
2382	a1	Around what time should I call you next weekend?
2382	b1	Saturday afternoon sounds good.
2383	a2	Alright, I will call you then.
2383	b2	Sure, maybe text me first because I may be running some errands before that.
2384	a3	If I don't respond to your text it may be because I am in the shower.
2384	b3	What if I just call you?
2385	a1	Why is that bill so high?
2385	b1	It's because we had that water leak
2386	a2	Yeah, that is right. Hopefully we can get the leak fixed as soon as possible.
2386	b2	How much will it cost?
2387	a3	A lot. We'll be living on raman noodles for a while.
2387	b3	Good thing I love raman!
2388	a1	Do you have any big plans for the holiday weekend?
2388	b1	Yes, I'm hoping to go visit friends in Toronto. How about you?
2389	a2	I plan to go to garage sales.
2389	b2	Are you looking for something special?
2390	a3	Yes, Im looking for a dresser.
2390	b3	I have an antique dresser in my attic you may be interested in.
2391	a1	When do we eat?
2391	b1	We'll be eating shortly.
2392	a2	I'm not really hungry.
2392	b2	Do you want to push back dinner, then?
2393	a3	No, you can go ahead and eat and I will have something a bit later.
2393	b3	okay, i'll have then
2394	a1	How come she gets the larger steak?
2394	b1	Because she paid for the larger steak.
2395	a2	I guess you get what you pay for.
2395	b2	You can say that again.
2396	a3	Next time I should probably order the larger one.
2396	b3	That would be my suggestion.
2397	a1	Do you know what happened to my shirt?
2397	b1	I think the dog ate it
2398	a2	That must be a joke.
2398	b2	OK, the dog just mauled it.
2399	a3	Your right my shirt is ruined.
2399	b3	Thankfully it wasn't one of your favorites!
2400	a1	How have you been?
2400	b1	Pretty good, you?
2401	a2	Not really. My mother died last month. It's so hard on us all right now.
2401	b2	I'm so sorry to hear that!
2402	a3	She had been sick for a while, so it was kind of expected.
2402	b3	My Heartily condolences go to you and your family.
2403	a1	Is the line to the bathroom really long?
2403	b1	yes the line to the bathroom is long like the Disneyland lines.
2404	a2	Oh, then I will just wait until we get home.
2404	b2	Probably your best option.
2405	a3	Then we probably need to leave now since they never have enough stalls for women.
2405	b3	Okay, let's go. I don't want you to have an accident.
2406	a1	What is wrong with you?
2406	b1	Nothing at all, why?
2407	a2	You were really mean to the new girl.
2407	b2	She's my step-sister! And she purposely wrecked my shoes last night!
2408	a3	Oh,.well then, of course it's alright to be mean to her then.
2408	b3	Wow, it didn't take much for you to see me point of view.
2409	a1	When do you have to be home?
2409	b1	I need to be home by 11pm.
2410	a2	I think we can manage that. The movie is over at 10:30.
2410	b2	You think we should bring a blanket?
2411	a3	Yeah I think we should! Can you bring one? I don't think I have any at home.
2411	b3	Sure, I will bring the blanket.
2412	a1	What made you wake up early?
2412	b1	I have to go to work.
2413	a2	I meant earlier this morning because I could hear you downstairs coughing.
2413	b2	Oh, that. I think it was just the fact that the room was light.
2414	a3	If the light wakes you up, you should pull the shades down before you go to sleep every night. You woke me up moving around and coughing.
2414	b3	I am so sorry about that! I will be careful next time.
2415	a1	How do we get there?
2415	b1	You can take a right at the next traffic light.
2416	a2	OK, what do I do after that?
2416	b2	I'm not sure, let me look.
2417	a3	Okay. Hurry up, though, it's green.
2417	b3	I will get back to you. Let me think
2418	a1	How much is it for just one?
2418	b1	You will pay one dollar for one person.
2419	a2	Do you take cash?

2454	a1	Do you want something to eat?
2454	b1	Yes, I'm starved.
2455	a2	Me too, let's get pizza!
2455	b2	I know a great pizzeria that is not very far away.
2456	a3	I know which one you're talking about. I think they're great, too.
2456	b3	Alright! Let's get going!
2457	a1	Why should I close the window?
2457	b1	You will let in flies.
2458	a2	Maybe i'd rather have the flies, it's so hot in here!
2458	b2	Just remember that when they are crawling on you.
2459	a3	Hey, brilliant idea! Why don't we buy window screens!
2459	b3	Sounds good! Let's go to the hardware store right now before it gets any hotter.
2460	a1	What would you like?
2460	b1	I would love a million dollars please.
2461	a2	I'd love to give you that but I can't.
2461	b2	That's a real shame.
2462	a3	I don't think so
2462	b3	Can I get another wish?
2463	a1	I also like baseball, do you?
2463	b1	No much. I prefer football
2464	a2	I like football as well!
2464	b2	Baseball does not have enough action to keep me interested.
2465	a3	It's a more cerebral game, that's for sure.
2465	b3	Are you saying I'm stupid?
2466	a1	What do you do?
2466	b1	I stay at home with my children.
2467	a2	Oh, how old are your children?
2467	b2	Two and four, they sure keep me busy.

2468	b3	I sure do! Do you have any children?
2469	a1	What do you want to do?
2469	b1	I don't know, what do you want to do?

2471	b3	This conversation is not getting us very far!
2472	a1	Did you watch the football game last night?
2472	b1	No I went to be early
2473	a2	Too bad, it was a great game.
2473	b2	Really? I don't really like watching football.
2474	a3	Who doesn't like football?
2474	b3	I just don't care for it enough to stay up late.
2475	a1	Have you see what the dog was wearing today?
2475	b1	no I haven't paid attention to it
2476	a2	The dog is wearing clothes, and you couldn't be bothered to notice what clothing the dog is wearing?
2476	b2	Well, I'm feeling quite sleepy today.
2477	a3	You really must be.
2477	b3	you work all day so long thats why.
2478	a1	When will I get to see you again?
2478	b1	Maybe for the holidays.
2479	a2	That seems so far away.
2479	b2	OK, how about we video chat then?
2480	a3	It's not the same, though. Can't you come before?
2480	b3	I will try, but I'm not sure I can get the time off work.
2481	a1	Did you plant tomatoes?
2481	b1	No, I don't like tomatoes.
2482	a2	What else did you plant?
2482	b2	Eggplant, squash and cucumbers.
2483	a3	So, any particular reason for your lack of love for tomatoes?
2483	b3	Because they are disgusting pieces of squishy fruit that have no place in a proper salad.
2484	a1	Have you met my husband?
2484	b1	I think so. Kevin, right? With a beard?
2485	a2	No, Ralph, very bald, hairless actually.
2485	b2	Oh, so who was the bearded guy I saw you with the other day?
2486	a3	You mean my older brother? He was visiting from out of town.
2486	b3	okay, I thought he was your husband
2487	a1	What aren't you telling me?
2487	b1	Nothing, I have told you everything I know.
2488	a2	I can tell by your shifty eyes that you're lying!
2488	b2	What are you accusing me of?
2489	a3	You are hiding something from me!
2489	b3	No. I swear i'm not!
2490	a1	Do you have more than one?
2490	b1	I have three total I believe.
2491	a2	So more than one.
2491	b2	Wow, you are so perceptive.
2492	a3	I guess I am. So, can you lend me one?
2492	b3	I could, but then I would have to worry about when I was going to get it back.
2493	a1	Did anyone take out the trash?
2493	b1	No, I forgot to when I left the house. I'll take it out now.
2494	a2	Thanks, I really appreciate it.

2495	a3	I did. They are in the pantry.
2495	b3	I can't find them here. Are you sure you put them in the pantry?
2496	a1	What time is it?
2496	b1	It's 9 o'clock.
2497	a2	Oh no, I better get home so I can let my dog out.
2497	b2	Please drive safely.
2498	a3	Of course I will.
2498	b3	Goodbye! See you tomorrow.

2504	b3	I'll bet you a free lunch that I did better than you.
2505	a1	Do you like jokes?
2505	b1	Of course I do! Go ahead, I can tell you have a good one for me, let's hear it.
2506	a2	I asked if you like jokes, not if you want to hear one.
2506	b2	Now that's disappointing. I was ready to be amused.
2507	a3	I have many jokes but they aren't appropriate for church.
2507	b3	Is that a joke?
2508	a1	Can we go to the movie, tomorrow?
2508	b1	Sure, as long as you get all your homework done tonight.

2510	b3	That is very sweet, I love you too.

2517	b1	Blue, most of the time.
2518	a2	Most of the time? What is it the rest of the time?
2518	b2	The rest of the time, I prefer chartreuse.
2519	a3	Chartreuse? Never heard of it. Is it French?
2519	b3	No, it's a color.
2520	a1	Where are my friends now?
2520	b1	I think that they are in their dance class now.
2521	a2	Oh, I was hoping we could have all gone to see a movie together

2524	a2	Please tell me!
2524	b2	No peeking until Christmas.
2525	a3	Well, if you say so, but I won't tell you what I got you, either!
2525	b3	I accept this compromise.

2527	a2	That sounds delicious
2527	b2	Well I'm glad you think so.
2528	a3	Especially the way you make it.
2528	b3	Stop it! you're making me blush again.
2529	a1	Did you get the homework done?
2529	b1	Yes I got some homework.
2530	a2	No, I asked if it was done, not if you had some.

2618	b3	Why wouldn't you want to be Sally?
2619	a1	What should we have for breakfast?
2619	b1	I think we should make some breakfast pizza.
2620	a2	Maybe we can have brunch instead!
2620	b2	Sounds good, because I'm in the mood for a mimosa.
2621	a3	I thought you said pizza?
2621	b3	Why not both?
2622	a1	When is the surgery scheduled?
2622	b1	It's scheduled next Wednesday
2623	a2	So, you're going to drive me, right?
2623	b2	Of course! When should I pick you up?
2624	a3	Can you pick me up at noon? I have to be there by one to fill out paperwork.
2624	b3	okay no issues.
2625	a1	How is your break going?
2625	b1	It's fine and I have the possibility to relax.
2626	a2	Do you have any fun plans for your break?
2626	b2	Yes! I might try that new restaurant that just opened.
2627	a3	Cool! I just tried it yesterday and they have some pretty good dishes!
2627	b3	what would you recommend?
2628	a1	Do you eat pickles?
2628	b1	NO I hate them
2629	a2	why do you hate them, they are so tangy!
2629	b2	There's something about the smell that is off-putting.
2630	a3	I guess some can say it's an acquired taste.
2630	b3	I love olives though.
2631	a1	Where is your father?
2631	b1	In the living room watching football.
2632	a2	Oh, I thought the game already ended.
2632	b2	He's watching the college game now.
2633	a3	He hasn't moved from that couch in four hours. Do you think he might be asleep?
2633	b3	How can we tell?
2634	a1	I am hungry, when is lunch?
2634	b1	Around 1 o'clock
2635	a2	What are we having?
2635	b2	Peanut butter sandwiches.
2636	a3	Oh, that sounds good.
2636	b3	If you're really lucky I might even put some jelly on it for you.
2637	a1	How about next weekend?
2637	b1	No, next weekend is no good. I'm going to be in Vancouver.
2638	a2	Oh, I love that city!
2638	b2	Yes, it's one of my favorite places.
2639	a3	How often have you been to Vancouver? I go all the time for work.
2639	b3	only couple of times
2640	a1	You don't like it?
2640	b1	I do, I would just prefer a different color.
2641	a2	You are never happy with anything that I like.
2641	b2	Don't be so critical; it's really just your color preference that I find lacking.
2642	a3	Oh it's way more than that.
2642	b3	Stop being so negative. How about we chose a color that we both like?
2643	a1	Can you please let the dog out?
2643	b1	It's already out
2644	a2	Will you make sure it comes back in when it's done?
2644	b2	Yes, I promise I will.
2645	a3	You can't find the dog, can you?
2645	b3	I know exactly where he is. He just hasn't finished yet.
2646	a1	Will you get my reports and deliver them to my doctor?
2646	b1	I will do
2647	a2	Thanks, the doc is upstairs to the right, around the corner, third door on the left.
2647	b2	Thanks for giving me so much detail
2648	a3	Don't mention it
2648	b3	Will it be long before the doctor receives the reports?
2649	a1	How is your father?
2649	b1	He's doing pretty good. Going fishing with the boys this weekend.
2650	a2	And your mother?
2650	b2	She's as busy as ever!
2651	a3	And your sister?
2651	b3	She's good, just got engaged and is turning into Bridezilla.
2652	a1	Where do you live?
2652	b1	I live in Miami, FL.
2653	a2	Do you enjoy living there?
2653	b2	I really love it! There's great weather, great food, and great culture.
2654	a3	Have you always lived there?
2654	b3	No. I used to live in Texas.
2655	a1	Did you get good sleep last night?
2655	b1	I slept 8 hours.
2656	a2	When did you have to wake up this morning?
2656	b2	I woke up around six.
2657	a3	Wow, you got up early.
2657	b3	Yeah I have a busy day.
2658	a1	Which store has the best craft beer selection?
2658	b1	I'm not really sure. Arturo's Liquor, maybe?
2659	a2	Great, I'll stop by there after work.
2659	b2	Oh, I forgot, they aren't open on Sunday's.
2660	a3	I guess I'll try them tomorrow, then.
2660	b3	Swing by my house when you leave there.
2661	a1	I have my driver's license. Do you have yours?
2661	b1	Of course, it's in my wallet.
2662	a2	Ok good. Hopefully they will let us in then.
2662	b2	The line looks really long though. Are you sure this is the club you want to go to?
2663	a3	Yes, but if you would rather not wait we can go to a different one.
2663	b3	If you don't mind waiting, neither do I.
2664	a1	Where are you from?
2664	b1	I hail from Jamaica.
2665	a2	Weird. I don't hear any accent.
2665	b2	I went to an American school.
2666	a3	Cool. Where in Jamaica?
2666	b3	I went to school in the capital.
2667	a1	Oh, I am so sorry to hear that, why not try to sleep now?
2667	b1	You're right. I need to get some rest.
2668	a2	Would you like to use our guest room until dinner is ready?
2668	b2	That would be amazing.
2669	a3	Go upstairs, first door on the right.
2669	b3	See you in a bit.
2670	a1	How old is your son?
2670	b1	12 next year
2671	a2	He will be driving before you know it!
2671	b2	I know! Did you know he wants to start dating already?
2672	a3	That's pretty much what most boys at that age wants to do.
2672	b3	Yeah, but I think it's too soon though.
2673	a1	How are you guys doing?
2673	b1	We are doing fine, thanks for asking.
2674	a2	You're welcome! You all should come visit sometime!
2674	b2	I'd love that! When are you free?
2675	a3	My schedule is pretty full but maybe sometime this summer?
2675	b3	Sound good- maybe a Fourth of July party?
2676	a1	Do you think that bugs have souls?
2676	b1	I believe all living things have souls.
2677	a2	I do as well
2677	b2	Demon souls, that is.
2678	a3	Oh, you silly!
2678	b3	How did we get on this subject anyway?
2679	a1	Can I give it a try?
2679	b1	No you need a licence.
2680	a2	What sort of licence?
2680	b2	A fishing license.
2681	a3	How do I go about getting he license today so I can try it?
2681	b3	you can apply online
2682	a1	Whose turn is it?
2682	b1	It's your turn
2683	a2	How was your day?
2683	b2	It was horrible.
2684	a3	Oh no! Tell me what happened!
2684	b3	don't feel like discussing
2685	a1	Where are you from?
2685	b1	I'm originally from Minneapolis, Minnesota.
2686	a2	Why did you move from there?
2686	b2	I went off to college. Couldn't pass up a basketball scholarship.
2687	a3	That's a shame. What do you do for a living now?
2687	b3	I don't think it was a shame. Now I'm a basketball coach.
2688	a1	Is there something on my back?
2688	b1	It's a spider!
2689	a2	No! Get it off!
2689	b2	No I don't want to touch it!
2690	a3	Grab that magazine and use it!
2690	b3	YOU grab the magazine and use it yourself!
2691	a1	Where did you go?
2691	b1	Sorry, I just went to run some errands and pick up dinner. Were you worried?
2692	a2	Yes I was. I thought you got kidnapped.
2692	b2	Yep, I got kidnapped and now I'm back. Anyway, ready to eat?
2693	a3	Your cynical remarks will get you nowhere.
2693	b3	Neither will your judgmental assessments.
2694	a1	Are you going to the baby shower?
2694	b1	No, I can't make it.
2695	a2	Why? Do you have some other important plans?
2695	b2	Actually, I do. I'm going in for liposuction.
2696	a3	Can't you reschedule that?
2696	b3	No, I'm sorry, I can't.
2697	a1	How can you tell when someone is lying to you?
2697	b1	If they avoid looking in your eyes.
2698	a2	Can you tell if I'm lying to you right now when I say I value your friendship?
2698	b2	I think you're lying for sure.
2699	a3	yeah, you suck as a lie detector
2699	b3	Fine, you are my best friend.
2700	a1	Where is the bathroom?
2700	b1	Over in the back corner
2701	a2	That's a potted plant
2701	b2	No, there's the bathroom door behind the plant!
2702	a3	You mean I have to go around that plant to get to the bathroom? That plant's HUGE!
2702	b3	Yes you will need to go around the plant, is that an issue for you?
2703	a1	I can't really respond by text can you call me instead?
2703	b1	I will call you in some minutes, okay?
2704	a2	OK, I'll wait for your call.
2704	b2	Talk to you soon.
2705	a3	Hey, so, what's up?
2705	b3	Uh, I was wondering why you couldn't respond by text?
2706	a1	Are we having lunch soon?
2706	b1	Yes, just a few minutes.
2707	a2	I am starving to death over here!
2707	b2	I seriously doubt that!
2708	a3	I haven't eaten in two days!
2708	b3	Then maybe you should have my lunch too!
2709	a1	Can we go to the park?
2709	b1	what can we do in the park?
2710	a2	Swing and talk like we used to.
2710	b2	That sounds awfully nostalgic, let's get ice cream first like old times.
2711	a3	Oh yes, that sounds nice.
2711	b3	And finally we can end the day by sitting on the porch and yelling at kids to stay off our lawn.
2712	a1	Is there any news yet?
2712	b1	No news yet
2713	a2	Will you text me if there is?
2713	b2	As soon as I hear anything.
2714	a3	I am worried if she is alright
2714	b3	i will let you know once I hear anything.
2715	a1	did she pee her pants?
2715	b1	I think she must have.
2716	a2	She must be so embarassed.
2716	b2	She doesn't look embarrassed.
2717	a3	Well, she's only two years old!
2717	b3	Been there, done that.
2718	a1	What is your name?
2718	b1	My name is Al. What's yours?
2719	a2	My name is Maria. I was named after my grandma.
2719	b2	Who do you think I am named after?
2720	a3	Probably Al Bundy. Why are you shouting?
2720	b3	because you made me joyfull
2721	a1	When did Scott get home?
2721	b1	At 1:00 pm
2722	a2	Is that his usual time?
2722	b2	No, but he got stuck at the office.
2723	a3	Yeah, that happens.
2723	b3	I hate being done late like that.
2724	a1	How is she going to get there?
2724	b1	I don't know
2725	a2	Did you offer to drive her?
2725	b2	No, she's far too mean for me to spend time with her like that.
2726	a3	Then why did you invite her in the first place?
2726	b3	I felt like I had to. She was standing there when Sandy brought it up.
2727	a1	Can you fix the computer for me?
2727	b1	yes I can
2728	a2	It gave me the blue screen of death after downloading a few games.
2728	b2	Ah, I'm sorry. I'll try to make that better.
2729	a3	All right, please do.
2729	b3	Were there any messages before the blue screen?
2730	a1	What do you want to do?
2730	b1	I would like to go to the movies.
2731	a2	Awesome! I'll go bring the car around!
2731	b2	See you soon then!
2732	a3	Think of what you want to watch when we get there.
2732	b3	lets watch something funny.
2733	a1	Where are you from?
2733	b1	I'm from America.
2734	a2	What state are you from?
2734	b2	I'm from Ohio. How about you?
2735	a3	I am from the state of Arizona.
2735	b3	I'm so sorry to hear that. Perhaps you could relocate?
2736	a1	How much homework do you have?
2736	b1	None. I'm 42 years old. What a bizarre question.
2737	a2	I wasn't talking to you. Go away.
2737	b2	Fine. No need to be rude.
2738	a3	If you don't like my attitude take a hike
2738	b3	No, you take a hike. This is my house!
2739	a1	Where is the library?
2739	b1	On the corner of Main and Poplar
2740	a2	Do you know the hours?
2740	b2	I believe it's open 9-5 during the week.
2741	a3	Do you go there often?
2741	b3	Yeah, I use their computers a lot.
2742	a1	What's your kid been up to lately?
2742	b1	That is none of your business.
2743	a2	No need to be so rude!
2743	b2	I just get tired of people asking.
2744	a3	Better to be asked than for people not to care!
2744	b3	Not when asking becomes conversations I don't care for or have time to have.
2745	a1	What movie was she in?
2745	b1	She was in Gone with the Wind
2746	a2	I knew I recognized her.
2746	b2	Do you know what other movies she was In?
2747	a3	Um, I think maybe that movie about breakfast somewhere.
2747	b3	Are you talking about Breakfast at Tiffany's?
2748	a1	Did you buy a new coat?
2748	b1	Thank you for noticing. Do you like it?
2749	a2	How could one not notice that? You can see it from the moon.
2749	b2	Is that good or bad?
2750	a3	Well, that depends on how you look at it.
2750	b3	Well I love it
2751	a1	Will I get to see your brother?
2751	b1	If he is home
2752	a2	Does he go out much?
2752	b2	He is gone most of the time, he is really busy.
2753	a3	What does your brother do to keep him so busy?
2753	b3	he works a lot
2754	a1	Where is your restroom?
2754	b1	Around that corner.
2755	a2	Which corner, the one to the right or left?
2755	b2	The one on the right
2756	a3	Okay, thank you!
2756	b3	Is there any toilet paper?
2757	a1	What kind of music do you like?
2757	b1	Mostly death metal.
2758	a2	Cool, what bands do you listen to?
2758	b2	I love the Dresden Dolls.
2759	a3	Aren't they a group for old ladies?
2759	b3	Punk rock old ladies, maybe!
2760	a1	Do you have my email ID?
2760	b1	Yes, I do.
2761	a2	Why are you yelling?
2761	b2	I'm sorry, I forgot caps lock was on.
2762	a3	Do you remember my password?
2762	b3	No, you should remember your own passwords!
2763	a1	Can you call my son?
2763	b1	I need his phone number first.
2764	a2	So you're saying you can't?
2764	b2	That's exactly what I am saying. Why don't you call your son?
2765	a3	He won't answer my calls.
2765	b3	And why is that?
2766	a1	Where can I purchase this product?
2766	b1	You can purchase it at home depot.
2767	a2	I always get lost in that store.
2767	b2	Maybe you could ask a sales associate to help you find it then.
2768	a3	That seems to be what always happens to me.
2768	b3	And do they help you?
2769	a1	May I call you sometime?
2769	b1	Sure. Do you have my number?
2770	a2	I sure do! I have it saved in my phone.
2770	b2	I thought so.
2771	a3	I hope we can have another date really soon.
2771	b3	I would really like that.
2772	a1	How was your day at work?
2772	b1	It was cool today.
2773	a2	What were you working on?
2773	b2	Mind your own business.
2774	a3	You must have had a bad day to be so grouchy!
2774	b3	Don't get me started.
2775	a1	Can you do me a favor?
2775	b1	I'll try, what Is It?
2776	a2	Taste this milk and see if it's bad?
2776	b2	No way I'm going to taste that milk!
2777	a3	why don't you like it
2777	b3	I don't like it because you think it might be bad.
2778	a1	Do you want to go grocery shopping?
2778	b1	Yes what time?
2779	a2	whenever is best for you.
2779	b2	How about we leave In 15 minutes?
2780	a3	we can leave in 15 minutes.
2780	b3	Great, see you out front in 15.
2781	a1	What time would you like me to come?
2781	b1	How about 8:00?
2782	a2	That sounds sorta perfect.
2782	b2	You're sorta perfect.
2783	a3	Oh? Is that where we're going with this?
2783	b3	Is that where you want it to go?
2784	a1	Can you hang my clothes please?
2784	b1	Yes, I can.
2785	a2	Great, Thank you!
2785	b2	Do you have more clothes to wash?
2786	a3	No, just the jumbo load I did earlier.
2786	b3	Ok, then I will start my laundry if you're done.
2787	a1	Did the phone ring?
2787	b1	Yeah it was a wrong number
2788	a2	Was it the hotline bling?
2788	b2	No some guy with an accent was asking me if my refrigerator was running.
2789	a3	Sure it was.
2789	b3	Are you doubting me? You don't know me! You can't judge me! YOU'RE NOT MY MOTHER!
2790	a1	I am busy at the moment, can we talk later?
2790	b1	Yeah just call me then.
2791	a2	Is 9.00pm ok?
2791	b2	9:00pm should be fine.
2792	a3	Are your kids in bed at that time?
2792	b3	Yes, they will be fast asleep so don't worry. I'll keep the ringer off just in case.
2793	a1	Do you know where my keys are?
2793	b1	Yeah, you left them in your jacket pocket.
2794	a2	Oh no, the jacket that just went into the washing machine?
2794	b2	Uh oh. Yes, that's the one, unfortunately.
2795	a3	Ah, ok. I will have to fish them out.
2795	b3	They should be fine
2796	a1	Did you receive the check that I sent to you in the mail?
2796	b1	Yes, but I did not appreciate what you wrote in the memo field of the check!
2797	a2	I was just kidding around.
2797	b2	Well I didn't find it funny!
2798	a3	It'll keep you smiling while the check bounces.
2798	b3	Figures, coming from you!
2799	a1	Is there any food left?
2799	b1	A little bit, but we should really go grocery shopping sometime today.
2800	a2	I hate going to the grocery store on a Saturday.
2800	b2	Sometimes we can't avoid that which we hate.
2801	a3	I guess we still need to eat.
2801	b3	Or we could order delivery pizza or Chinese food.
2802	a1	Could you please get me a drink of water?
2802	b1	Sure. Would you like ice in it?
2803	a2	Oh! Yes please!
2803	b2	No problem, be right back.
2804	a3	Make sure you use a clean glass!
2804	b3	Are there actually dirty glasses in with the clean dishes?
2805	a1	Did you get the oil changed in the car?
2805	b1	I don't even know how to change the oil, brah.
2806	a2	Yes, it's way overdue!
2806	b2	Where should I take it to have it done?
2807	a3	Take it to the Dodge dealership down the street from us. They will change it for you.
2807	b3	Ok, thanks for the advice.
2808	a1	Did you drink the last of the milk?
2808	b1	Nope, it wasn't me. Milk makes me all phlegm-y.
2809	a2	You are really missing something, chocolate milk is the bomb.
2809	b2	Maybe so, but I didn't drink it.
2810	a3	Good more for me then.
2810	b3	I tried chocolate almond milk once, never again!
2811	a1	Do you want to get together for a movie Friday?
2811	b1	I am busy Friday, how about Saturday?
2812	a2	I'm busy Saturday, how about Sunday?
2812	b2	I'm busy Sunday, how about Monday?
2813	a3	I think I will ask someone else out instead seeing as you can't make time for me.
2813	b3	Well that is pretty rude surely we can a good day for both of us.
2814	a1	Have you met my bother?
2814	b1	Yes, we met at the concert last month.
2815	a2	Where was my invitation?
2815	b2	I think your brother used it.
2816	a3	I am going to kick his butt!
2816	b3	He told me you couldn't come!
2817	a1	Have you read any good books lately?
2817	b1	No. I've been too busy to read
2818	a2	Oh, you should make time to read this great book I just read.
2818	b2	What's the title of the book?
2819	a3	I can't remember exactly, the title was something about a red tent.
2819	b3	okay will read it.
2820	a1	Would you like to have something to drink?
2820	b1	I will have anything cold to drink.
2821	a2	There's soda in the fridge.
2821	b2	Great, thank you.
2822	a3	You're welcome. Help yourself.
2822	b3	Can I get a straw somewhere?
2823	a1	Do you want to go get lunch?
2823	b1	No thanks. I'm on a diet.
2824	a2	We can eat some salad instead.
2824	b2	Thats okay I brought food from home, maybe next time though.
2825	a3	Okay, suit yourself
2825	b3	How about a rain check for tommorow?
2826	a1	Does your daughter like vegetables?
2826	b1	Yes she does like them.
2827	a2	I wish it were so easy with mine. I have to trick her into eating them.
2827	b2	She might grow out of that.
2828	a3	I sure hope so, it would make things easier.
2828	b3	Their palettes change every seven years!
2829	a1	Did you speak to the doctor?
2829	b1	Yes I did, thank you.
2830	a2	And what did he tell you to do?
2830	b2	Actually, my doctor's a woman. She said I should work on my posture and exercise.
2831	a3	Oh that's good to know, at least it's not something that requires extensive treatment.
2831	b3	Well, I might also need physiotherapy, which can get expensive.
2832	a1	How is your wife doing after her surgery?
2832	b1	She's doing okay
2833	a2	Is there anything I can do to help?
2833	b2	I could really use help picking up the kids from school so my wife isn't home alone.
2834	a3	No problem! What time are they done?
2834	b3	They are done at three PM.
2835	a1	Can you get me a glass of water?
2835	b1	I will get you a glass. Do you want ice?
2836	a2	Yes please, and a slice of lemon if you have it.
2836	b2	Sure. Would you like one slice or two?
2837	a3	Only one slice please.
2837	b3	Did you want a big glass or a small one?
2838	a1	Where are the beer bottles?
2838	b1	I put them in the recycle bin.
2839	a2	but they were still full!
2839	b2	My house, my rules!
2840	a3	Fine, you'll find your coffee in the trash bin tomorrow.
2840	b3	As long as I find it hot and in my favorite mug.
2841	a1	Who won the Cubs game?
2841	b1	I don't know, let me check the news.
2842	a2	Check the homepage, it's bookmarked there.
2842	b2	If you have it bookmarked, why not check yourself?
2843	a3	Because, you're sitting nearer to my computer.
2843	b3	The computer is literally two inches from your hand. You're just being lazy, Tony.
2844	a1	How much does this cost?
2844	b1	too much money
2845	a2	What do you think would be a reasonable cost?
2845	b2	About half what they're currently charging, I think.
2846	a3	Do you think you could dicker it down?
2846	b3	I didn't go to law school for nothing.
2847	a1	Can we go out dancing?
2847	b1	Yes I have to get dressed first.
2848	a2	I want to dance the salsa.
2848	b2	That's fine, but you still need to put on pants first.
2849	a3	Maybe I'll invent a new dance that I dont need pants for!
2849	b3	I think there is a dance out there like that already.
2850	a1	Could you please get something out of my purse for me?
2850	b1	Sure. What do you need?
2851	a2	The beef jerky stick please.
2851	b2	I don't see it in here. Am I missing something?
2852	a3	Two eyeball and a brain by the sound of it.
2852	b3	You don't have to be rude!
2853	a1	You are late, what happened?
2853	b1	I got a flat tire.
2854	a2	Okay, call me next time you're going to be late.
2854	b2	I will, I'm sorry about that.
2855	a3	Just make sure you call me next time.
2855	b3	I will. Do you have a preferred number?
2856	a1	When do we go to the doctor?
2856	b1	Later this afternoon. Our appointment isn't until 3pm.
2857	a2	Oh yeah! That is right! Silly me, I forgot!
2857	b2	How could you forget something so important?
2858	a3	My ADHD, which is why we're going.
2858	b3	What did you say? My alzheimers must be acting up.
2859	a1	How are you doing?
2859	b1	I am doing great!
2860	a2	Do you have anything special planned?
2860	b2	A nice hike to the mountains.
2861	a3	Oh nice, which mountain range?
2861	b3	Not really a range, just some mountains about an hour north of my house.
2862	a1	Are my reports normal?
2862	b1	I would say so, everything looks to be in order.
2863	a2	Great, mind if I go ahead and leave then?
2863	b2	Sure, put them on my desk.
2864	a3	All right. So, see you back when?
2864	b3	First thing tomorrow morning, sounds good?
2865	a1	Do you have a restroom I could use?
2865	b1	Restrooms are for customers only.
2866	a2	I really need to go. Can I please use it?
2866	b2	I'm sorry sir, but according to our policy you must buy something in order to use the restroom.
2867	a3	Ill buy a pack of gum then.
2867	b3	I can't believe I have to buy gum to use your restroom.
2868	a1	What can you cook?
2868	b1	I can cook lots of things.
2869	a2	Do you know how to make lasagna?
2869	b2	Not really, but I can make a great omelet.
2870	a3	Can you make me a veggie omelet?
2870	b3	Sure I can.
2871	a1	Can you help me out here?
2871	b1	give me a minute
2872	a2	OK, let me know when you're ready.
2872	b2	Okay, I'm ready. What do you need?
2873	a3	I can't reach this bottle on the top shelf.
2873	b3	I will get it for you.
2874	a1	Do you like going camping?
2874	b1	I love camping, especially in the mountains!
2875	a2	Where would you recommend?
2875	b2	Any of the national parks are great.
2876	a3	Which one is your favorite?
2876	b3	I like Yellowstone.
2877	a1	Did you win the contest?
2877	b1	No. I lost once again
2878	a2	Maybe you should take a break from it next year.
2878	b2	You lose all the contests you never join!
2879	a3	OK, please don't yell at me.
2879	b3	I'm not yelling. I'm just excited.
2880	a1	Have you seen my black wool hat?
2880	b1	I think it's under the couch.
2881	a2	What's it doing under the couch?
2881	b2	The kids were playing dress up and hid it there.
2882	a3	You let the kids play with my hat? I got that in London.
2882	b3	Ugh, they didn't hurt your hat.
2883	a1	Did you get the keys to the car?
2883	b1	Nah. I just hot wired it instead.
2884	a2	What? How did you learn how to do that?
2884	b2	My brother taught me when I was ten.
2885	a3	Was he a car thief?
2885	b3	That's funny. But no, he learned from a cousin of mine who loved everything about cars.
2886	a1	Will you be going on vacation this summer?
2886	b1	No, we are saving money to go on a trip this fall.
2887	a2	Oh! Are you looking to go someplace in particular?
2887	b2	Yes, a National Park.
2888	a3	Which one?
2888	b3	Yellowstone. It had good reviews on travelocity.
2889	a1	When will you be home?
2889	b1	I'll be home later today.
2890	a2	What are you planning to do when you get home?
2890	b2	I thought I would make a banana cream pie.
2891	a3	Do you need me to get some bananas for you at the grocery store?
2891	b3	No thank you. I believe that we already have bananas in the house.
2892	a1	What have your tried?
2892	b1	I tried everything I could think of.
2893	a2	Ok, well you've got to be more specific than that. What have you tried?
2893	b2	I tried sending an email, calling, texting and I drove over to his house.
2894	a3	Maybe you should leave a note on his car.
2894	b3	I don't want to seem like a total stalker.
2895	a1	May I have it?
2895	b1	Yes you may
2896	a2	Would you hand it over?
2896	b2	Yes, of course.
2897	a3	Thank you! That was kind of you.
2897	b3	You're welcome. Do you want another one?
2898	a1	What is happening there?
2898	b1	It appears a man has died.
2899	a2	Has someone already called the police?
2899	b2	Yes, the police and ambulance arrived about 10 minutes ago.
2900	a3	Is foul play suspected?
2900	b3	I don't think so.
2901	a1	Whose got the dill pickles?
2901	b1	they are in the fridge
2902	a2	Can I have the rest?
2902	b2	Can you leave me one for my burger tonight?
2903	a3	Sure thing, no problem.
2903	b3	Should I stock up on dill pickles for the future?
2904	a1	Would you like a cup of tea?
2904	b1	No, thank you, but I would take water.
2905	a2	Any preference for temperature?
2905	b2	Ice cold please.
2906	a3	Our refrigerator is broken and I have no ice. Is cold from the tap OK?
2906	b3	Nah, I'll just go to Taco Bell and get some.
2907	a1	What time is it?
2907	b1	Half past four
2908	a2	What time do you want to start cooking dinner?
2908	b2	In about 45 minutes or so. You have time to relax for a little bit first.
2909	a3	Relax? You've spent the whole afternoon watching the Real Housewives!
2909	b3	you are more then welcome to start dinner yourself.
2910	a1	Do you like movies?
2910	b1	Yes, I love horror movies.
2911	a2	Are you a fan of The Exorcist?
2911	b2	It was one of the first horror movies I saw!
2912	a3	What do you think of the sequels?
2912	b3	Nothing's as good as the original, but they were OK.
2913	a1	Did you know our flight was delayed?
2913	b1	yes, and I'm not happy about it.
2914	a2	Me neither, but I am glad we leave first thing in the morning.
2914	b2	I suppose. Is the airline putting us up in a hotel for a night?
2915	a3	A dingy hotel on the other side of town was what I was told.
2915	b3	Sounds about right.
2916	a1	Can you please get me my phone?
2916	b1	Sure, here it is.
2917	a2	I didn't want it back broken.
2917	b2	I didn't realize I had broken it.
2918	a3	The screen wasn't cracked when I loaned it to you.
2918	b3	It was not intentional, I'm sorry
2919	a1	Do you think driving your car causes climate change?
2919	b1	I think it contributes to global warming.
2920	a2	I agree with you!
2920	b2	What do you think we should do about it?
2921	a3	Make a commitment to use public transportation at least three days a week. It isn't much but it is a start.
2921	b3	But doesn't public transportation add to the problem as well?
2922	a1	How come you don't get fat eating all of this?
2922	b1	Lucky metabolism, I guess.
2923	a2	My metabolism is so slow that when I look at a piece of cake, I gain 5 pounds.
2923	b2	That sounds awful, I would hate to feel that way!
2924	a3	That's why I never look at fatty foods!
2924	b3	You must, because you're still fat!
2925	a1	Could you please open this for me?
2925	b1	Yes I can.
2926	a2	Thank you very much, you must be strong!
2926	b2	Thanks, I work out.
2927	a3	Are you a member of a gym?
2927	b3	Yes I go every day.
2928	a1	What did you do last weekend?
2928	b1	I mowed my lawn.
2929	a2	Did you get your seedlings planted, too?
2929	b2	I did in the back yard.
2930	a3	The same yard you mowed? Dude, you probably ripped them all up again!
2930	b3	Um, I mowed around them.
2931	a1	Why is it so hot today?
2931	b1	Because there is a heat wave.
2932	a2	Did you go outside? It is a scorcher!
2932	b2	We really need to get our air conditioning fixed, can you call the repairman?
2933	a3	Sure I will get that done right away.
2933	b3	I sure hope they can come quickly, before we melt!
2934	a1	Do you know her?
2934	b1	no, we never met
2935	a2	Then why does she tell me you're dating?
2935	b2	She said what? To whom?
2936	a3	Dude she has been telling everybody!
2936	b3	That girl is seriously crazy!
2937	a1	Hello, where is a good place to eat?
2937	b1	Try the steak house on the corner.
2938	a2	Okay, do they know how to cook a steak?
2938	b2	I would assume so, since they do good business.
2939	a3	Good to know, thanks.
2939	b3	your welcome dear.
2940	a1	Do you have the number for a cab?
2940	b1	Yes, I will give it to you.
2941	a2	Thank you so much.
2941	b2	Actually, I am going downtown. Do you need a ride?
2942	a3	I would love one. What are you going downtown for?
2942	b3	I need some supplies.
2943	a1	Did you see the football game last night?
2943	b1	No. Football is like brain cancer.
2944	a2	What do you mean when you say it's like brain cancer?
2944	b2	I mean it's a waste of time that saps your energy needlessly.
2945	a3	Football is life! How can you say that!
2945	b3	Football isn't life. If it is your life, you need to get a new one.
2946	a1	Have you seen this?
2946	b1	No, what Is It?
2947	a2	I'm not sure, it looks like some kind of worm doesn't it?
2947	b2	It's pretty gross.
2948	a3	Do you think we should capture it for the zoo?
2948	b3	I don't think they would be interested in such creature.
2949	a1	Did she call you yet?
2949	b1	She hasn't called yet, but she did send a text a few minutes ago.
2950	a2	What did she say?
2950	b2	She said she was held up at work.
2951	a3	That's too bad.
2951	b3	I'm going to call her tonight.
2952	a1	And how are your children?
2952	b1	My children are fine.
2953	a2	That's good! I can remember when they were born!
2953	b2	I know. Hard to believe how much they've grown.
2954	a3	Yes it's amazing how time flies.
2954	b3	Indeed! it does.
2955	a1	Do you have the time?
2955	b1	For you, yes.
2956	a2	Aw, that's so sweet of you!
2956	b2	Thanks, it's 2:15.
2957	a3	I can't believe how late it is.
2957	b3	Time flies when you're having fun.
2958	a1	Do you come to school by bus?
2958	b1	No I walked today
2959	a2	Makes sense, it's so nice out today.
2959	b2	Are you going to be able to make it home on time?
2960	a3	I hope so, lets see what time I get out of here.
2960	b3	I can get my mom to give you a lift if you want?
2961	a1	What is for dinner?
2961	b1	Tonight we are having paella.
2962	a2	Are we having anything with it or just paella?
2962	b2	We'll have some rice and beans too.
2963	a3	That sounds delicious.
2963	b3	I'm glad you think so!
2964	a1	Have you been taking your meds?
2964	b1	Mind your own business for once! As soon as this month is finished I am moving out and finding a new roommate. I am sick and tired of you!
2965	a2	I was just trying to be nice since you look sick.
2965	b2	If you want to be nice then ask how you can help.
2966	a3	I'm sorry; I didn't mean to upset you. But you don't usually want any help.
2966	b3	Sorry. I'm grouchy today, bro.
2967	a1	Can you help me?
2967	b1	Yes, what do you need?
2968	a2	This math problem is really stumping me up.
2968	b2	Ok, let's go through it step by step to see where your problem is.
2969	a3	Oh wait, I see what I was missing. Thanks for you help.
2969	b3	No worries. Anytime you need.
2970	a1	How did you like the movie?
2970	b1	It was great.
2971	a2	Great like the Lion King was great, or Great like Captain America level great?
2971	b2	First of all, the Lion King is way better than Captain America, but it was only Wedding Crashers great.
2972	a3	That's not very great in my book.
2972	b3	What was wrong with Wedding Crashers?
2973	a1	WHat do you do?
2973	b1	I work as a window-cleaner.
2974	a2	Do you have to go up to tall buildings?
2974	b2	Sometimes. And yes, it is a bit scary. I'm terrified of heights.
2975	a3	Wow, the things we do for money.
2975	b3	Yeah, a guy's gotta eat.
2976	a1	Is there any extra credit?
2976	b1	On this particular class, no there is not.
2977	a2	Oh my, looks like I will need a tutor.
2977	b2	I can tutor you.
2978	a3	That would be wonderful!
2978	b3	When would you like to start?
2979	a1	Could you please call my attorney for me?
2979	b1	If you can give me his number I will.
2980	a2	Yes, one second let me just look it up.
2980	b2	Have you found the number yet?
2981	a3	I'm looking for it now.
2981	b3	Ok I will wait.
2982	a1	Do you like vegetables?
2982	b1	No, not really. But I do like fried okra.
2983	a2	Last I heard that was a vegetable.
2983	b2	Yeah, but when you fry it it's awesome.
2984	a3	It may be awesome but frying it basically takes all of the vegetable out of it!
2984	b3	I eat for taste, it tastes great.
2985	a1	How much did that cost?
2985	b1	About three fifty.
2986	a2	Wow, that is a good deal.
2986	b2	You're telling me, it was quite a steal.
2987	a3	Where did you get it?
2987	b3	I bought it online through Amazon.
2988	a1	How is school going?
2988	b1	It's going well!
2989	a2	Have you made a lot of new friends?
2989	b2	No, everyone hates me.
2990	a3	What makes you think everyone hates you?
2990	b3	They keep saying I hate you when they pass me in the hallway.
2991	a1	What kind of flowers do you prefer?
2991	b1	I like orchids, remember!
2992	a2	Oh I thought you liked lilacs, weird.
2992	b2	Why would you think that?
2993	a3	I could have sworn I head you say it once
2993	b3	Come to think of it, I might have said that quite a while back.
2994	a1	Can you try that one more time?
2994	b1	yes but it's the last time
2995	a2	Why? If you loved me you would try, try, again.
2995	b2	Maybe we aren't right for each other anymore.
2996	a3	Well screw you then.
2996	b3	Excuse me. You have no right to speak to me like that. If you are willing to let go this easily instead of working out our issue then maybe you are right, maybe we just aren't meant for each other.
2997	a1	What is the weather today?
2997	b1	It's sunny and hot.
2998	a2	What will it be like tomorrow?
2998	b2	Tomorrow will be rainy, which makes me really sad!
2999	a3	Why sad? I love the rain!
2999	b3	i was planning for a ride.
3000	a1	Will you pour me some water?
3000	b1	Absolutely, I'd love to do that for you.
3001	a2	Thanks, while you are at it, fix me a sandwich too.
3001	b2	Any thing else your highness?
3002	a3	Not right now, but I'm sure I'll think of something later.
3002	b3	Well, please don't hesitate to ring the bell if you do.
3003	a1	Will you be visiting me again tomorrow?
3003	b1	For the last time, Princess, no. The dragon will keep you company.
3004	a2	The dragon sucks at poker, though.
3004	b2	Come on, it's great at Backgammon!
3005	a3	Yeah but he insists we play poker.
3005	b3	Well ask the Ogre to play.
3006	a1	Where are you man?
3006	b1	I'm on the bus.
3007	a2	Where are you heading?
3007	b2	I'm going to Reno.
3008	a3	Why in the world are you going to Reno?
3008	b3	the question is why are you not going to Reno?
3009	a1	Can you inform Sarah and ask her to visit me?
3009	b1	I will ask her to visit you.
3010	a2	I need you to inform her also, don't forget about it.
3010	b2	I won't forget, don't worry.
3011	a3	Ok, please don't and I just need to say inform again, it's my word of the day.
3011	b3	Thank you for informing me.
3012	a1	Have you seen him today?
3012	b1	No I saw no sign of him.
3013	a2	I have a message for him and I don't know when he will be back.
3013	b2	Ok, well put a note on his desk then.
3014	a3	Okay, I'll tape it to his computer screen.
3014	b3	I am sure he will be in shortly, he's rarely ever this late.
3015	a1	What's the weather going to be tomorrow?
3015	b1	Sunny at morning, but rainy at night
3016	a2	Perfect, I love nighttime storms.
3016	b2	I would like them more if they didn't scare my dog.
3017	a3	Just get a different dog then.
3017	b3	A dog isn't like a blender.
3018	a1	How long until the game starts?
3018	b1	I think it'll be another half hour
3019	a2	Great. I think it'll be a good game today.
3019	b2	I think so too with everything that has been going on with the team lately.
3020	a3	I hope Suarez recovers soon, they still need him.
3020	b3	he will be available from next game.
3021	a1	What kind of breakfast foods do you like?
3021	b1	I really like french toast or danish.
3022	a2	I'm not too hot on that, personally.
3022	b2	Well what breakfast foods do you prefer?
3023	a3	I prefer bacon and eggs.

3029	a3	Let me go check in my bag.
3029	b3	Give me as soon as you find.
3030	a1	How are you doing?
3030	b1	I'm doing okay. A little tired, but otherwise fine.
3031	a2	Oh no, why are you feeling tired?
3031	b2	I have had trouble sleeping lately due to leg cramps.
3032	a3	Make sure to hydrate properly and get exercise.
3032	b3	I've heard eating bananas and drinking milk helps too, because of the potassium and calcium.
3033	a1	Are you cooking tonight?
3033	b1	Yes every night this week.
3034	a2	Do you love cooking?
3034	b2	At times I do.

3037	b2	Yes, it's enough time.
3038	a3	I hope you're right, you can't miss your flight!
3038	b3	Don't worry so much, I will make it.
3039	a1	Could you pick up some groceries at the store?
3039	b1	Of cause. I'll do it on my way home from work
3040	a2	Awesome! Please get some milk and water.
3040	b2	Sparkling or plain water?
3041	a3	Plain, and grab just half a gallon of milk, I don't want it going bad.
3041	b3	we can put it in refrigerator
3042	a1	Is Stacy coming this weekend?
3042	b1	No Next weekend
3043	a2	I am so excited to see her, I can't wait!
3043	b2	I think she has dyed her hair purple.
3044	a3	Well, that sounds like Stacy.
3044	b3	She is always doing unique stuff isn't she!
3045	a1	Do you want to take a study break?
3045	b1	Sure, I could use some coffee
3046	a2	Great, let's go to the coffee shop on Main Street.

3047	a3	Sure, food sounds good.
3047	b3	So, let's go
3048	a1	Do you know anybody?
3048	b1	Yes lots of people
3049	a2	How many of them are not white?
3049	b2	That's a pretty mean allegation.
3050	a3	Well you didn't answer the question.
3050	b3	I have a wide array of friends.
3051	a1	What are you making for dinner?
3051	b1	I'm making spaghetti with meat balls
3052	a2	Great! I'll bring over some garlic bread.
3052	b2	Could you bring a salad too?
3053	a3	Sure I would be glad to.
3053	b3	I have soda. If you want beer you can bring that too.
3054	a1	Where is the remote?
3054	b1	I don't know, I've been looking for it. I hope it didn't accidentally get thrown away.
3055	a2	Why would you say that? Did you accidentally throw it away?
3055	b2	If it was accidental how would I know?
3056	a3	Yes, good point.
3056	b3	Did you check in the couch cushions?
3057	a1	Can I have an extra pillow?
3057	b1	Yes, here it is.
3058	a2	Thank you very much. Sleep well!
3058	b2	Don't forget you're making breakfast in the morning.
3059	a3	What would you like me to make?
3059	b3	I would love some eggs and bacon, and definitely coffee!
3060	a1	Would you like something to drink?
3060	b1	A big glass of cold water would be great.
3061	a2	Coming right up!
3061	b2	Thank you, I'm really thirsty!
3062	a3	Would you like something to eat also? I have some delicious cookies.
3062	b3	Cookies sound perfect, but do you have milk?
3063	a1	Where is you car?
3063	b1	I left It at home and rode with a friend.
3064	a2	I see, can I get a ride with them too?
3064	b2	Yeah sure, come right in.
3065	a3	Thanks! Taking a taxi would've cost me an arm and a leg!
3065	b3	Are you sure she will cool with one more passenger?
3066	a1	How is mutton prepared here?
3066	b1	We prepare it with white wine and onions.
3067	a2	Oh! That sounds amazing! I can't wait to try some!
3067	b2	It's awesome, you'll love it!
3068	a3	I sure hope so.
3068	b3	What is mutton?
3069	a1	Are Sam and Sarah still together?
3069	b1	I don't know!
3070	a2	I thought they were going to break up soon.
3070	b2	Could be, I haven't heard.
3071	a3	I saw Sam with Heather the other day.
3071	b3	Did he say anything?
3072	a1	What date is the luncheon?
3072	b1	If I remember correctly, the email said Friday the 23rd.
3073	a2	Yea, I can't make it as I have to sleep in that day.
3073	b2	You are lazy.
3074	a3	No I am not!
3074	b3	Admit it. You can't stand Ralph.
3075	a1	I haven't see you in ages, is everything ok?
3075	b1	Everything is great!
3076	a2	Really? What's been happening?
3076	b2	I just got a new job and a new house!
3077	a3	That's great news. Do you want to meet up soon?
3077	b3	I would love to! How does next weekend sound?
3078	a1	What is the problem officer?
3078	b1	You were speeding.
3079	a2	I was? I never drive on this road and wasn't sure what the speed limit was.
3079	b2	You were 10mph over the speed limit.
3080	a3	Sorry, I didn't see any posted speed limit signs.
3080	b3	I will let you off with a warning this time, but please don't let it happen again.
3081	a1	What did he say?
3081	b1	I'm not sure, I couldn't hear him.
3082	a2	Yeah, the music was pretty loud!
3082	b2	I had trouble hearing anyone.
3083	a3	I can barely hear you!
3083	b3	Maybe you should get your hearing checked.
3084	a1	Where are you my love?
3084	b1	I'm on my way to you.
3085	a2	How far away are you?
3085	b2	Stuck in traffic on the 405. I'll be a little late.
3086	a3	Don't forget we're having dinner with the Rattigans tonight.
3086	b3	you sure thats tonight?
3087	a1	Did you feed the cat?
3087	b1	I tried to give her some scraps but she wouldn't eat.
3088	a2	Why dont you give her her food rather than scraps?
3088	b2	I couldn't find it.
3089	a3	It's in the cabinet, where it usually is.
3089	b3	Yeah, no, I looked and there wasn't any, we must be out. I will run to the store.
3090	a1	What does this mean?
3090	b1	I'm not sure.
3091	a2	Why are you yelling at me?
3091	b2	Sorry, I have a cold so I didn't realize.
3092	a3	All good. What is your best guess at the translation?
3092	b3	I have no clue.
3093	a1	What are your plans for Saturday?
3093	b1	I think I am going to hang out with some friends.
3094	a2	Can I come with?
3094	b2	Sure, they'd love to meet you. How do you feel about sushi?
3095	a3	I'm not crazy about it, but if that's what everyone else wants, that's fine.
3095	b3	We can go somewhere else I guess
3096	a1	Can I go to the gym tonight?
3096	b1	Did you do your homework?
3097	a2	I finished it during study hall.
3097	b2	Then yes you can go to the gym. Have a good work out!
3098	a3	Thanks! I'm going to try out the new equipment tonight.
3098	b3	Don't work out too much, I don't want you to end up looking better than me.
3099	a1	What kind of books do you prefer?
3099	b1	The kind with pictures. How about you?
3100	a2	I prefer short novels.
3100	b2	What's the last good book you read?
3101	a3	I can't remember the name off the top of my head, but I'll let you know when I get home.
3101	b3	That sounds like a plan!
3102	a1	May I see a menu?
3102	b1	Our menus are on the table along wall, please help yourself.
3103	a2	What would you recommend?
3103	b2	I would recommend the steamed snails with ginger.
3104	a3	My gosh, how exotic.
3104	b3	We also have Alligator sauteed with our house special sauce. A true hit for the adventurous type.
3105	a1	Could you please call the electric company for me?
3105	b1	Sure, what is their number?
3106	a2	The number is in the address book next to the phone.
3106	b2	Is the address book the blue leather book?
3107	a3	No, it is the little black book under the phone.
3107	b3	OK, I'll get the number and make the call.
3108	a1	What's your favorite type of animal?
3108	b1	I prefer dogs.
3109	a2	Dogs are mine favorite too, they are so loyal.
3109	b2	So much better than cats in my opinon.
3110	a3	Except tigers. Tigers are amazing.
3110	b3	They are so majestic.
3111	a1	Why haven't you been to the store yet?
3111	b1	l took a nap.
3112	a2	Could you try and go before the store closes?
3112	b2	Yes, sure. I'm sorry.
3113	a3	It's ok but we really need diapers and milk.
3113	b3	I'll go in a minute.
3114	a1	Did you see the trailer for suicide squad?
3114	b1	Yes I can't wait for it to come out in theaters.
3115	a2	Should we go together to see it?
3115	b2	Why don't we get a group together?
3116	a3	Ok. I'll text everyone and see who wants to go with us.
3116	b3	This is going to be awesome.
3117	a1	What made you so tired?
3117	b1	I only slept 3 hours last night.
3118	a2	Why, didn't you sleep well last night?
3118	b2	My husband kept snoring.
3119	a3	Does he snore often?
3119	b3	Yes he is like a buzz saw.
3120	a1	Shall we have lunch now?
3120	b1	Yes please. I'm starving!
3121	a2	Me too, I have been waiting for this all day.
3121	b2	Sorry, you could have called me earlier if you were hungry!
3122	a3	I didn't want to bother you!
3122	b3	I'm bothered now because im hungry!
3123	a1	Have you seen our dog?
3123	b1	No, I'm sorry. I haven't seen your dog but I will keep an eye out for it.
3124	a2	Thank you so much! He is my baby.
3124	b2	Maybe we should make some flyers and put a lost ad on craigslist.
3125	a3	Sounds like a great idea.
3125	b3	Do you want me to make a flyer for you?
3126	a1	Could you please change the TV channel to the news?
3126	b1	Okay, where's the remote? Oh, here it is.
3127	a2	What do you think about this story?
3127	b2	I think It sounds too dramatic.
3128	a3	Oh, well if that's what you think.
3128	b3	You did ask what I thought.
3129	a1	Do you want to go biking tomorrow?
3129	b1	If I can borrow your pump for my tires.
3130	a2	Sure, if I can find it. I think I may have lent it to George and never got it back.
3130	b2	That sounds like George.
3131	a3	I'll call him and see if he still has it.
3131	b3	Okay, cool. Thanks.
3132	a1	Where are you from?
3132	b1	Fort Worth, TX
3133	a2	How long have you lived there?
3133	b2	About twenty years.
3134	a3	Wow! what part of the city do you live in?
3134	b3	I'm actually just below Fort Worth, by Waco.
3135	a1	Do you like fluffy dogs?
3135	b1	Of course I do. Who doesn't?
3136	a2	That's probably true.
3136	b2	Is this your way of hinting that you are getting me a puppy for my birthday?
3137	a3	No. Would you like one?
3137	b3	Yes! I would love a pomeranian!
3138	a1	Sure, when do you want me to mail?
3138	b1	as soon as possible
3139	a2	I can mail it for you tomorrow.
3139	b2	That's good, thanks.
3140	a3	Is there anything else you need me to do while I'm out?
3140	b3	No, that will be all thanks.
3141	a1	Hi there, how are you?
3141	b1	I'm good, how are you?
3142	a2	I've been better.
3142	b2	Oh no! What's the trouble?
3143	a3	I just lost my job.
3143	b3	I'm sorry to hear that! What happened?
3144	a1	I'm hungry, want to go grab a bite to eat?
3144	b1	Yes, I'm starving!
3145	a2	Cool! Let's go to KFC!
3145	b2	Does the KFC here have a buffet?
3146	a3	No, no one would ever leave if they did.
3146	b3	Can you imagine trying to kick everyone out at closing time?
3147	a1	Do you like going fishing?
3147	b1	Yes it is very relaxing.
3148	a2	What do you try to catch?
3148	b2	Whatever's biting and if nothing bites that's OK too.
3149	a3	Let's go fishing this weekend.
3149	b3	Sure, sounds great.
3150	a1	Where are we going?
3150	b1	Didn't you say you wanted to go back to that restaurant? I though that's where we were going to go.
3151	a2	I'm sorry, I forgot about that. Let's go there!
3151	b2	I'm not really that hungry anymore.
3152	a3	I'm not either.
3152	b3	Maybe we could just hang out at the park for a little while.
3153	a1	Can I get a ride?
3153	b1	Sure, get in.
3154	a2	Can you drop me off at the store?
3154	b2	What do you need to buy?
3155	a3	Milk and bread. It's going to snow you know.
3155	b3	You should get cheese and wine, that's much more fun.
3156	a1	Do you like orchids?
3156	b1	Yes they are very elegant flowers.
3157	a2	Do you grow them yourself?
3157	b2	I try to, sometimes.
3158	a3	I've tried too, but they always die on me.
3158	b3	They are very tricky to grow.
3159	a1	How many people have this disease?
3159	b1	15% of the population.
3160	a2	How many will die?
3160	b2	I estimate 10% of the people that get the disease will die.
3161	a3	How many will eventually survive?
3161	b3	it would be less than 5%
3162	a1	I have arrived, where are you?
3162	b1	I am next to the bar.
3163	a2	Which end of the bar?
3163	b2	Over by the drunk blonde.
3164	a3	He does seem a bit tipsy, doesn't he?
3164	b3	Maybe , he shouldn't be served any more.
3165	a1	When did you start playing video games?
3165	b1	When my mum got me a Mega Drive for Christmas.
3166	a2	You have a great mom.
3166	b2	yeah, she has a great kid too!
3167	a3	And that kid is so modest!
3167	b3	Yes, that's one of my best qualities, one of many.
3168	a1	Where is the nearest splash pad?
3168	b1	Just across the street.
3169	a2	Thanks! I can't wait to go get cooled off.
3169	b2	It is horribly humid today, isn't it.
3170	a3	It sure is
3170	b3	Don't take this the wrong way, but aren't you a little old to go to a splash pad by yourself?
3171	a1	Can we go to the grocery store after the doctor?
3171	b1	That's a great idea, because we need bread.
3172	a2	what else do we need to get?
3172	b2	we also need to get something for dinner.
3173	a3	What are we having?
3173	b3	I found a new recipe to try out, Stuffed Squid.
3174	a1	Can I come over?
3174	b1	What time would you want to come over?
3175	a2	I was thinking around six, right after work?
3175	b2	Make it eight and you got a date.
3176	a3	Please make it before seven
3176	b3	Okay, but I won't have time to cook then.
3177	a1	Did you see me in the crowd?
3177	b1	Yes, it was hard to miss you with your rainbow coloured speedo and pink feather boa!
3178	a2	Haha, I always like to wear something special!
3178	b2	You're one in a million, George! Hey, how's Elaine doing?
3179	a3	She's alright. Getting real sick of her pushing me around though.
3179	b3	What is going on between you two, George?
3180	a1	I have sen a beautiful new car outside, is it yours?
3180	b1	Yes, the Altima is mine.
3181	a2	How is the mileage?
3181	b2	It's fantastic and so much better than my old SUV.
3182	a3	I could never go from my SUV to a car, even for better mileage.
3182	b3	its economic. Saves Fuel.
3183	a1	Does the fur get in the way?
3183	b1	Of course not.
3184	a2	How often do you have to have Pickles groomed?
3184	b2	Once a month
3185	a3	Isn't that kind of expensive?
3185	b3	I see it as an investment, because I like to believe Pickles loves me more when I get her groomed.
3186	a1	How have you been doing?
3186	b1	Things went very well for me, thanks.
3187	a2	I'm so happy to hear that.
3187	b2	How are you doing? I heard that you have a new job.
3188	a3	I do. I think it's going to be great, but I've only been there a week.
3188	b3	What do you think of it so far?
3189	a1	What brand is that?
3189	b1	It's Torrid! I love it.
3190	a2	How much was it?
3190	b2	I can not remember it was affordable though.
3191	a3	Where did you get it?
3191	b3	Macys, nice sale.
3192	a1	What do you think about this?
3192	b1	Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
3193	a2	You're lying. It is scientifically impossible for people to think nothing.
3193	b2	What about if they are dead?
3194	a3	I don't think they count as people if they are dead.
3194	b3	so a dead person is no longer a person?
3195	a1	Do you like this song?
3195	b1	Yes, I love the '80s.
3196	a2	What is your favorite song from the 80's?
3196	b2	I can't pick just one!
3197	a3	That is true, there are just too many great hits!
3197	b3	I do love Bon Jovi, though.
3198	a1	So where are we heading to?
3198	b1	We are going to Florida.
3199	a2	What part of Florida?
3199	b2	I think the keys sound nice.
3200	a3	We better get some suntan oil on the way down. You know how I burn!
3200	b3	I'm afraid suntan oil won't keep you from burning, better get sunscreen.
3201	a1	What time is it?
3201	b1	It's 10 AM.
3202	a2	We are late for the movies.
3202	b2	Oh no, I can't believe it!
3203	a3	Do you want to see another one?
3203	b3	Yeah, I am OK with seeing a different movie. I'm flexible!
3204	a1	What is your phone number?
3204	b1	I'll give it to you later.
3205	a2	That's smart, shouldn't give your number to strangers.
3205	b2	Just kidding, I'll give it now.
3206	a3	Thanks. I'll call.
3206	b3	Looking forward to it!
3207	a1	Have you ever had a a mango?
3207	b1	Yes, it's one of my favorite fruits.
3208	a2	Aren't they delicious!
3208	b2	They really are wonderful in smoothies.
3209	a3	They are also great candied and dried.
3209	b3	The first mango I ever ate was in Haiti, right off a tree!
3210	a1	Are there any more peanuts?
3210	b1	Yes, in the pantry.
3211	a2	I looked in there five times and I can't find them.
3211	b2	Check behind the big box of oatmeal, second shelf, on the right.
3212	a3	You must have hidden them yourself.
3212	b3	Of course I did. I love peanuts!
3213	a1	Can you go out and play with my dog?
3213	b1	As long as he doesn't bite me.
3214	a2	He won't, he's friendly.

3296	a3	I pawned it so we could afford the tickets.
3296	b3	Seriously, Kim? You were not kidding when you said you were worried about your future.

3314	b3	For what? The bus?
3315	a1	Do you know how to make coffee?
3315	b1	Instant coffee or with beans?
3316	a2	With beans, of course! I can't stand instant coffee.
3316	b2	Instant coffee is what kept my family afloat during the Depression!
3317	a3	And people rode boxcars, we're in the 21st Century now.
3317	b3	That was random! Ha ha.

3335	a3	Do you want to meet up that night for dinner?
3335	b3	Sure, does nine sound good for you?
3336	a1	Is there anything else on TV?

3341	b3	I wish I could knit!
3342	a1	How long does it take for this medicine to work?

3344	a3	Is there any way I can speed it up?
3344	b3	Not really. Drink a glass of water and go lay down.

3348	b1	No I would like to stay in.
3349	a2	Why so? Are you tired or plain boring?
3349	b2	I just don't feel like leaving the house. Let's watch a video and drink some wine.
3350	a3	Fine, but, can we at least order some takeout?
3350	b3	I think that's a great idea. Chinese or Moroccan?
3351	a1	Can I use your phone?
3351	b1	Sure you can
3352	a2	Thanks a lot!
3352	b2	But, please don't fiddle with the settings.

3360	a1	Did you take all the medication given to you?
3360	b1	No, I stopped taking it after a few days because of the funny side effects.
3361	a2	What kind of side effects were you having?
3361	b2	Well I could pass through walls, disappear, and fly.
3362	a3	Wow, that must have been a bit scary.
3362	b3	Just a bit!
3363	a1	How often do you come here?
3363	b1	I come here once a day
3364	a2	Do you like it here?
3364	b2	It is rather peaceful and reminds me of my youth.
3365	a3	I had no idea you thought so highly of McDonald's.
3365	b3	It's the little things in life that make you happy.

3374	a3	But you're the paper mill's owner!
3374	b3	CEO, not owner. The location is not up to me.
3375	a1	Hi, where are you?

3380	a3	Very funny dear.
3380	b3	I'm not kidding.
3381	a1	Where is your bathroom?
3381	b1	Down the hall and to the left.
3382	a2	do you know if it's occupied?
3382	b2	Go find out yourself.
3383	a3	If you're in that kind of mood, maybe I'll just go home.
3383	b3	Just kidding, it's available.
3384	a1	What did you do to make your arm sore?
3384	b1	I was cleaning out the attic this weekend. We had lots of heavy boxes.
3385	a2	You are supposed to lift with your legs.
3385	b2	My legs don't go up that high.
3386	a3	Next time get help.
3386	b3	I don't think you got the joke there bud.
3387	a1	What time is the event?
3387	b1	It is at 6 tonight. Please don't be late!
3388	a2	Why would I be late?
3388	b2	I know that you have to work until 5:30 and it will take you 20 minutes to get there.
3389	a3	I made arrangements to get off early.
3389	b3	Perfect. Thanks for thinking ahead to arrange to leave early.
3390	a1	When are you going on vacation?
3390	b1	We leave in August.
3391	a2	Will you be back before the wedding?
3391	b2	I'm afraid not.
3392	a3	But you already RSVP'd.
3392	b3	Well then why did you even ask?
3393	a1	Are you allergic to anything?
3393	b1	I have an allergy to peanuts and hydrocodone.
3394	a2	That's a pain.
3394	b2	Literally when you can't have the hydrocodone or your throat swells!
3395	a3	Do you have any other dietary restrictions?
3395	b3	Well aside from eating peanut butter, a gift from the gods and all other things containing peanuts, no.
3396	a1	What is she like?
3396	b1	She's not very nice
3397	a2	Well that's a huge let down.
3397	b2	She's an amazing artist though.
3398	a3	Maybe you just caught her on a bad day.
3398	b3	NO. She really looks horrible.
3399	a1	What kind of car do you drive?
3399	b1	I drive a Porsche.
3400	a2	Oh. Well isn't that fancy.
3400	b2	No need to get your knickers in a knot over it, you were the one who asked.

3401	b3	Who are you, Sigmund Fraud? Get it, fraud?
3402	a1	What did you do yesterday?
3402	b1	Mostly worked on my thesis.
3403	a2	Please tell me you didn't sleep in the library again?
3403	b2	I wish I could tell you that, but I can't.
3404	a3	Why can't you tell me?
3404	b3	I have not slept in two days.
3405	a1	How are you doing?
3405	b1	Very well, thank you
3406	a2	That's great to hear as I have been worried since the incident.
3406	b2	Oh, right. It did take a little while to recover, but I'm back to normal now!
3407	a3	Great, want to go for a hike with me this weekend?
3407	b3	Hike? How about a walk? I haven't tested my knee on high terrain yet.
3408	a1	Was there a lot of traffic on your way over to see me?
3408	b1	Yes, there was a lot of traffic on my way.
3409	a2	I'm glad you made it.
3409	b2	I hope there's not as much traffic on my way home.
3410	a3	Traffic has been bad lately because of all the construction work on the interstate.
3410	b3	I should have known that.
3411	a1	Would you like me to drive?
3411	b1	OK, maybe that's a good idea. I am getting a bit tired.
3412	a2	Alright, just pull over at the next rest stop.
3412	b2	Sounds good to me. Thanks.
3413	a3	No problem. How are we doing for gas?

3416	a3	Can we make it 2?
3416	b3	OK 2 seems fine.
3417	a1	who is she?
3417	b1	She is my great grandmother.
3418	a2	How old is she?
3418	b2	I think she is 83.
3419	a3	Wow that is really old.
3419	b3	You are extremely rude.
3420	a1	Can you bring me some salt for the chicken?
3420	b1	Okay, do you know which cabinet it is in?
3421	a2	Yeah, it's the white one to the left.
3421	b2	Here you go!
3422	a3	What other spices are you adding?
3422	b3	I've got that Italian herb blend you like to go on the chicken.
3423	a1	Where are you going this weekend?
3423	b1	Headed to D.C. to offer my advice to the president again.
3424	a2	What exactly are you going to advise him to do?
3424	b2	Sorry, I signed an NDA. That information is classified.
3425	a3	Well, as long as you are there, be sure to give him my regards, won't you?
3425	b3	I sure will! Would you like me to bring back a pastry from your favorite bakery near the Whitehouse?
3426	a1	Will you do me a favor?
3426	b1	Depends. Does it involve socks again?
3427	a2	Yes. I lost one in the dryer. Again.
3427	b2	I will find it for you.
3428	a3	Thank you so much!
3428	b3	You're welcome. You know how much I like socks.
3429	a1	What do you want for Christmas?
3429	b1	I would love a new science fiction novel for Christmas!
3430	a2	Great, what kind of science fiction do you like?
3430	b2	Anything, would you surprise me?
3431	a3	Well, it won't be much of a surprise now.
3431	b3	I'd still enjoy seeing what you would pick for me.
3432	a1	Who will you vote for in the election?
3432	b1	I haven't decided yet, have you?
3433	a2	I'm still undecided, too.
3433	b2	I'm not really excited about the options, to be honest.
3434	a3	Feels like a loss no matter who I vote for.
3434	b3	I might just make up a candidate and pencil them in.
3435	a1	What kind of movies do you like?
3435	b1	I love horror movies!
3436	a2	Do you get scared when you watch them?
3436	b2	Yes that's the fun of it.
3437	a3	Want to go and see one right now?
3437	b3	No way, I hate horror movies!
3438	a1	Why doesn't she visit me?
3438	b1	She is working long hours.
3439	a2	Oh. Tell her hello for me, please?
3439	b2	I sure will.
3440	a3	I wish she would not have to work such long hours, it's very stressful on her.
3440	b3	I agree, it sucks.
3441	a1	Can you bring my jacket?
3441	b1	Sure, which one do you want?
3442	a2	The black leather one with the ruffles please.
3442	b2	There's a pair of gloves here. Shall I bring them too?
3443	a3	Yes please. I hate cold hands.
3443	b3	Do you want a hat too?
3444	a1	Can you please ask for directions?
3444	b1	No, but you can
3445	a2	You know how terribly shy I am.
3445	b2	You're right, I'll ask for you.
3446	a3	Thank you, that is so sweet of you.
3446	b3	You're welcome. I love you.
3447	a1	Why does he do things like that to me?
3447	b1	He's just a jerk, that's why.
3448	a2	He will grow up someday.
3448	b2	Hopefully he grows up soon!
3449	a3	Let's slash his tires to teach him a lesson.
3449	b3	That's sinking to his level!
3450	a1	What's your favorite restaurant?
3450	b1	My favorite restaurant is Mahabhog Restaurant.
3451	a2	I thought they closed that place down
3451	b2	No, that was the place next door.
3452	a3	Then we should go to Mahabhog tonight.
3452	b3	I would rather try somewhere new.
1_p	a1	Would you like to sit down?
1_p	b1	No, I'm fine standing up
2_p	a2	Are you sure you don't want to sit down?
2_p	b2	Been sitting all day. Work was just one meeting after another.
3_p	a3	Oh, I'm sorry. I don't enjoy work days like that.
3_p	b3	It feels good to stretch my legs a bit.
4_p	a1	Would you like to go to the mall?
4_p	b1	Sure I'd love to
5_p	a2	What time do you want to leave?
5_p	b2	How about after my shower?
6_p	a3	How long will that take?
6_p	b3	Around 15 minutes maxx.
7_p	a1	Do you want to get McDonalds?
7_p	b1	No that food is too fatty.
8_p	a2	They have salads and stuff, too.
8_p	b2	I know but everything there just kind of tastes like McDonald's, you know?
9_p	a3	I do know. I think that's kind of the point. We can go somewhere else, though.
9_p	b3	I'm sorry, it's just that I have been having issues with smells recently and the whole place smells like grease. Why don't we go to Subway?
